# NICo API Configuration Reference

This document describes every section and field in the `nico-api-config.toml`
configuration file, which is deserialized into `NicoConfig` (defined in
`file.rs`). Fields are listed in declaration order. Defaults are noted where
applicable.

Unknown fields are reported after the base file, optional site override, and
`CARBIDE_API_` environment values are merged. They produce warnings by default
so configuration can be deployed ahead of the supporting binary. Set
`deny_unknown_fields = true` to reject them during startup. Diagnostics include
the invalid key's full section path and source. Names inside intentionally
dynamic maps, such as pool names and rack-profile IDs, remain user-defined;
fields within each map value must still match the documented schema.

The removed `force_dpu_nic_mode` and `rack_management_enabled` keys are
explicitly recognized, ignored, and reported as deprecation warnings. Use
`site_explorer.dpu_policy` instead of `force_dpu_nic_mode`.
`rack_management_enabled` lost its last runtime consumer when
[PR #1583](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/pull/1583) made Expected
Machine lookup during DHCP discovery unconditional. Remove both deprecated keys
from site configuration; compatibility parsing does not restore their former
behavior.

## `NicoConfig` (top-level)

| Field | Type | Default | Group | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| `listen` | `SocketAddr` | `[::]:1079` | `server` | Socket address for the gRPC API server. |
| `listen_only` | `bool` | `false` | `server` | Run passively (no background services, RPC/web only). Used in dev mode. |
| `metrics_endpoint` | `Option<SocketAddr>` | — | `integrations` | Socket address for the Prometheus `/metrics` HTTP server. |
| `alt_metric_prefix` | `Option<String>` | — | `integrations` | Alternative metric prefix emitted alongside `nico_` for dashboard migration. |
| `database_url` | `String` | **required** | `server` | Postgres connection string for all persistent state. |
| `max_database_connections` | `u32` | `1000` | `server` | Maximum database connection pool size. |
| `deny_unknown_fields` | `bool` | `false` | `server` | Reject unknown configuration fields instead of logging warnings and continuing. |
| `database_pool_acquire_timeout` | `Duration` | `30s` | `server` | How long a caller may wait for a connection from the pool before the attempt fails (sqlx's own default); trips on a stalled database or a saturated pool alike. Must be greater than zero (startup rejects `0`). |
| `database_pool_idle_timeout` | `Duration` | `10m` | `server` | Idle time after which the pool closes a connection, keeping the pool's own reaping well inside the Postgres server's 60-minute idle-session reaper. Must be greater than zero (startup rejects `0`). |
| `database_pool_max_lifetime` | `Duration` | `30m` | `server` | Maximum age of a pooled connection before it is recycled, so the pool re-balances onto the current primary after a database failover. Must be greater than zero (startup rejects `0`). |
| `database_startup_retry_timeout` | `Duration` | `5m` | `server` | How long to keep retrying the initial database connection at startup before giving up, so a transient outage (failover, rolling upgrade, DNS blip) doesn't take the process down. Retries use exponential backoff between attempts, starting at 1s and capped at 30s; each attempt itself is bounded by whatever time remains in this window (independent of `database_pool_acquire_timeout`), so total startup time never exceeds it. The last connection error is reported once the window elapses. `0` disables retrying: fail on the first attempt, bounded only by `database_pool_acquire_timeout` (the old behavior). |
| `api_admission_control` | `ApiAdmissionControlConfig` | *(see below)* | `server` | Fair per-client admission with global execution and pending-request limits for gRPC and admin HTTP business requests. |
| `ib_config` | `Option<IBFabricConfig>` | — | `hardware` | InfiniBand fabric configuration (see [IBFabricConfig](#ibfabricconfig)). |
| `asn` | `u32` | **required** | `networking` | Autonomous System Number, fixed per environment. Used by nico-dpu-agent for `frr.conf` BGP routing. |
| `dhcp_servers` | `Vec<Ipv4Addr>` | `[]` | `networking` | DHCP server addresses announced to DPUs during network provisioning. |
| `dhcpv6_server_preference` | `Option<u8>` | — | `networking` | Optional DHCPv6 Preference value emitted by DPU servers only in ADVERTISE messages. Accepts `0` through `255`; omission leaves the option absent and uses the protocol preference of zero. An explicit `0` remains present. Clients prefer larger values. Receiving an ADVERTISE with `255` causes immediate selection of that server without waiting for additional ADVERTISE messages. Core reads this setting only at startup; restart Core after changing it. During rolling upgrades, a DPU emits an explicitly configured value only when Core, its DPU agent, and its DHCP server support the field. An older component omits or ignores the field, preserving the default absence. |
| `ntp_servers` | `Vec<Ipv4Addr>` | `[]` | `networking` | Site-level NTP server IPs used for BMC time configuration and DHCP NTP Server configuration. |
| `route_servers` | `Vec<String>` | `[]` | `networking` | Route server IPs for L2VPN Ethernet Virtual network support. |
| `enable_route_servers` | `bool` | `false` | `networking` | Enables route server injection into DPU FRR configs for L2VPN. |
| `deny_prefixes` | `Vec<IpNetwork>` | `[]` | `networking` | IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR prefixes that tenant instances are blocked from reaching. FNN generates family-specific NVUE ACL policies; all non-FNN virtualizers apply the IPv4 prefixes only. |
| `site_fabric_prefixes` | `Vec<IpNetwork>` | `[]` | `networking` | IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes assigned for tenant use within this site. With `mutual_isolation`, ETV enforces the IPv4 prefixes with an isolation ACL only when the rendered DPU configuration has no NSG. An NSG replaces that ACL. With `open`, that ACL is not installed. On upgrade, authoritative Core scans persisted Ready and Deleting operator-managed SitePrefixes even when this list is empty. It assigns an unparented legacy VpcPrefix when exactly one operator root contains it; ambiguous parentage blocks startup. With a nonempty list, missing parentage also blocks startup. Listen-only replicas require an authoritative Core to assign unresolved lineage first. |
| `site_fabric_null_routes` | `Option<Vec<IpNetwork>>` | Inherited roots | `networking` | IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes installed by FNN as blackhole routes under `mutual_isolation`. Omission combines `site_fabric_prefixes`, every retained tenant-managed SitePrefix, and removed operator-managed roots that still contain a VpcPrefix or VPC-attached direct NetworkPrefix, reducing them to their minimal exact union. Soft-deleted children retain operator coverage until their VpcPrefix or segment is hard-deleted. An explicit list is authoritative: each CIDR uses its network address and exact duplicates are removed, but parent, child, and adjacent entries are not aggregated. Under mutual isolation, new tenant roots require an equal or broader explicit route; startup rejects an override that leaves any retained tenant root uncovered. An empty list (`[]`) installs no null routes and cannot support tenant roots under mutual isolation. Routes use administrative distance 250, so an authorized import wins only when it is at least as specific as the applicable blackhole. An effective `/0` null route and `leak_default_route_from_underlay = true` for the same address family are unsupported because the imported default wins the equal-prefix distance comparison. With `open`, the routes are not installed and tenant coverage is not required. Refer to [SitePrefix isolation rules](#siteprefix-isolation-rules) and [overlap checks](#tenant-prefix-overlap-checks). |
| `tenant_prefix_overlap_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | `networking` | Site opt-in for [tenant prefix overlap checks](#tenant-prefix-overlap-checks). Keep disabled through the [database cutover](#prefix-overlap-database-cutover). Enablement also requires DPU readiness and [site qualification](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/3902). |
| `max_site_prefixes_per_tenant` | `u32` | `8` | `networking` | Maximum tenant-managed SitePrefixes retained for one tenant at this site. Prefixes awaiting removal still count against this limit and keep their CIDR reserved. |
| `max_site_prefix_isolation_rules` | `u32` | `64` | `networking` | Maximum compacted legacy DPU site-prefix input for new tenant-root admission under mutual isolation; accepts `0` through `64`. Open isolation does not enforce this limit. This is not an FNN route-capacity limit. Refer to [SitePrefix isolation rules](#siteprefix-isolation-rules). |
| `anycast_site_prefixes` | `Vec<Ipv4Network>` | `[]` | `networking` | Aggregate IPv4 prefixes containing tenant-announced prefixes (e.g., BYOIP). **Deprecated.** Use [`routing_profiles.allowed_anycast_prefixes`](#fnnroutingprofileconfig) instead. |
| `common_tenant_host_asn` | `Option<u32>` | — | `networking` | ASN that tenants use to peer with the DPU. If unset, any ASN is accepted. |
| `vpc_isolation_behavior` | `VpcIsolationBehaviorType` | `MutualIsolation` | `networking` | VPC isolation policy: `mutual_isolation` or `open`. Set at installation; changing it on an existing site is not supported. |
| `host_naming_strategy` | `HostNamingStrategyKind` | `IpAddress` | `machines` | How new machine hostnames are derived: `ip_address` (IP-derived, e.g. `10-1-2-3`; the default and backwards-compatible), `fun` (stable adjective-noun handles like `wholesale-walrus`), `serial_number` (a machine's hardware serial -- the primary interface gets the bare serial, secondary interfaces get `serial-<mac>`, BMC interfaces stay IP-named), or `mac_address` (each interface's own MAC, e.g. `0a-1b-2c-3d-4e-5f`). Only `fun` leaves existing hostnames unchanged -- it keeps any real name, whether IP-, serial-, or MAC-derived, so after a switch fun names appear only on newly named interfaces; the others re-derive, so switching to one progressively renames interfaces as they reconcile. Junk placeholder serials (e.g. `To Be Filled By O.E.M.`) fall back to the IP name, and `serial_number` errors on duplicate serials rather than assigning a substitute name. |
| `dpu_network_monitor_pinger_type` | `Option<String>` | — | `networking` | Pinger implementation type (e.g., `"OobNetBind"`) for DPU link health checks. |
| `tls` | `Option<TlsConfig>` | — | `server` | TLS certificate/key paths (see [TlsConfig](#tlsconfig)). |
| `listen_mode` | `ListenMode` | `Tls` | `server` | Transport mode: `plaintext_http1`, `plaintext_http2`, or `tls`. |
| `auth` | `Option<AuthConfig>` | — | `server` | Authentication/authorization settings (see [AuthConfig](#authconfig)). |
| `pools` | `Option<HashMap<String, ResourcePoolDef>>` | — | `networking` | Resource pools that allocate IPs, VNIs, etc. Required but `Option` for partial-config merging. |
| `networks` | `Option<HashMap<String, NetworkDefinition>>` | — | `networking` | Networks to create at startup. Alternative: `CreateNetworkSegment` gRPC. `NetworkDefinition` supports IPv4-only, IPv6-only, and dual-stack segments with optional `prefix_v6` and `dhcpv6_link_address`. NICo saves the complete initial definition when it creates a segment. Later configuration edits do not update the existing segment or its saved definition. Refer to [Initial Network Configuration](../../../../docs/provisioning/ip-and-network-configuration.md#initial-network-configuration) for all prefix combinations, gateway requirements, examples, and compatibility. |
| `dpu_ipmi_tool_impl` | `Option<String>` | — | `machines` | IPMI tool implementation for DPU power control (`"prod"` or `"fake"`). |
| `dpu_ipmi_reboot_attempts` | `Option<u32>` | — | `machines` | Retry count when IPMI errors during DPU reboot. |
| `bmc_session_lockout_threshold` | `u32` | `3` | `security` | Consecutive BMC HTTP 401/403 responses before session-token login attempts stop for that BMC. |
| `bmc_max_sessions_per_caller` | `usize` | `4` | `security` | Cap on outstanding Redfish sessions per calling service identity per BMC; a `GetBmcCredentials` mint past the cap revokes that caller's oldest sessions. Values below 1 are treated as 1. |
| `bmc_proxy` | `Option<BmcProxyConfig>` | — | `security` | Routes this instance's ordinary BMC Redfish traffic — including established-endpoint credentialed exploration — through nico-bmc-proxy. Credential setup and rotation, session minting, exploration's anonymous vendor probes, and component-manager compute-tray power control (explicit per-endpoint credentials) always stay direct. |
| `ib_fabrics` | `HashMap<String, IbFabricDefinition>` | `{}` | `hardware` | InfiniBand fabrics managed by the site. Currently only one fabric is supported. |
| `initial_domain_name` | `Option<String>` | — | `machines` | Domain to create if none exist. Most sites use a single domain. |
| `initial_dpu_agent_upgrade_policy` | `Option<AgentUpgradePolicyChoice>` | — | `machines` | Policy for nico-dpu-agent upgrades. Also settable via `nico-admin-cli`. |
| `max_concurrent_machine_updates` | `Option<i32>` | — | `machines` | **Deprecated.** Use `machine_updater` instead. |
| `machine_update_run_interval` | `Option<u64>` | — | `machines` | Interval (seconds) at which the machine update manager checks for updates. |
| `retained_boot_interface_window` | `Option<Duration>` | — | `machines` | How long a retained boot interface pair (`retained_boot_interfaces` table) stays applicable after its `machine_interfaces` row was deleted. Unset retains forever; set a window (e.g. `30d`) so a MAC reappearing on different hardware doesn't inherit an obsolete Redfish interface id. |
| `site_explorer` | `SiteExplorerConfig` | *(see below)* | `hardware` | SiteExplorer hardware discovery settings (see [SiteExplorerConfig](#siteexplorerconfig)). |
| `vpc_peering_policy` | `Option<VpcPeeringPolicy>` | — | `networking` | VPC peering creation policy. `exclusive` admits capability-compatible pairs, while `none` or omission disables creation. The deprecated `mixed` value logs a startup warning and behaves as `exclusive`. ETV/FNN requests always return `InvalidArgument`. |
| `vpc_peering_policy_on_existing` | `Option<VpcPeeringPolicy>` | — | `networking` | Activation policy for stored VPC peerings. Omission falls back to `vpc_peering_policy`. `exclusive` enables the virtualization-specific mechanism only for compatible pairs: ETV emits peer-prefix ACL permits, while FNN imports peer-VNI route targets. `none` disables both mechanisms. The deprecated `mixed` value logs a startup warning and behaves as `exclusive`. |
| `attestation_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | `security` | Enables TPM-based machine attestation (adds `Measuring` state before `Ready`). |
| `bmc_rotation_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | `security` | Site-wide kill-switch for passive BMC credential rotation. When `false` (default), a Ready host never auto-enters `RotatingBmc`; the force-converge escape hatch bypasses it. |
| `uefi_rotation_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | `security` | Site-wide kill-switch for passive UEFI credential rotation (host and DPU). When `false` (default), a Ready host never auto-enters `RotatingHostUefi` nor drives its DPUs into `RotatingDpuUefi`; the per-machine force-converge escape hatch bypasses it. |
| `nic_lockdown_ikm_rotation_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | `security` | Site-wide kill-switch for NIC lockdown IKM rotation. When `false` (default), the SuperNIC lock/unlock flow keeps deriving keys from each card's current tracked IKM version, so a staged `RotateCredential(lockdown_ikm)` bumps the site-wide target without migrating any card. When `true`, the assignment-cycle lock derives from the staged site-wide target, so cards migrate to the new IKM as tenants cycle. Unlock always derives from the version a card is actually locked under regardless of this flag, so flipping it off never bricks an already-migrated card. |
| `bmc_factory_reset_on_instance_termination_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | `security` | Site-wide opt-in for factory-resetting the host BMC during tenant release. When `false` (default), tenant release proceeds directly to `PowerCycle`; when `true`, the release flow factory-resets the BMC, waits for it to return, restores the device's previous per-device credential, then continues with the existing power-cycle / boot-order repair. |
| `tpm_required` | `bool` | `true` | `security` | Require TPM module for machine registration. **Testing only** when `false`. |

| `network_security_group` | `NetworkSecurityGroupConfig` | *(see below)* | `networking` | NSG settings (see [NetworkSecurityGroupConfig](#networksecuritygroupconfig)). |
| `min_dpu_functioning_links` | `Option<u32>` | unset (effective value `2`) | `machines` | Controls DPU ToR BGP health checks. Refer to [DPU ToR Uplink Health](../../../../docs/dpu-management/dpu_configuration.md#dpu-tor-uplink-health) for values and lifecycle effects. |
| `host_health` | `HostHealthConfig` | *(default)* | `machines` | Host health monitoring thresholds for hardware health and DPU agent compliance. |
| `observability` | `ObservabilityConfig` | *(default)* | `integrations` | Observability settings shared across all state controllers (see [ObservabilityConfig](#observabilityconfig)). |
| `internet_l3_vni` | `u32` | `100001` | `networking` | Network infrastructure-provided L3 VNI for FNN VPC Internet connectivity. Combined with `datacenter_asn` for route-target. |
| `measured_boot_collector` | `MeasuredBootMetricsCollectorConfig` | *(see below)* | `security` | Measured boot metrics exporter (see [MeasuredBootMetricsCollectorConfig](#measuredbootmetricscollectorconfig)). |
| `machine_validation_config` | `MachineValidationConfig` | *(see below)* | `machines` | Machine validation tests (see [MachineValidationConfig](#machinevalidationconfig)). |
| `machine_identity` | `MachineIdentityConfig` | *(see below)* | `security` | SPIFFE JWT-SVID machine identity (see [MachineIdentityConfig](#machineidentityconfig)). |
| `bypass_rbac` | `bool` | `false` | `server` | Disables RBAC enforcement. **Testing/dev only.** |
| `dpu_config` | `DpuConfig` | *(see below)* | `machines` | DPU firmware and provisioning (see [DpuConfig](#dpuconfig)). |
| `fnn` | `Option<FnnConfig>` | — | `networking` | FNN L3 VNI overlay networking (see [FnnConfig](#fnnconfig)). |
| `bom_validation` | `BomValidationConfig` | *(see below)* | `machines` | BOM/SKU validation (see [BomValidationConfig](#bomvalidationconfig)). |
| `bios_profiles` | `BiosProfileVendor` | *(default)* | `machines` | BIOS profiles by vendor/model for Redfish BIOS management. |
| `selected_profile` | `BiosProfileType` | *(default)* | `machines` | Default BIOS profile type applied to machines. |
| `ewethers_config` | `Option<EwEthersConfig>` | — | `networking` | Cluster Interconnect (east-west Ethernet) config (see [EwEthersConfig](#ewethersconfig)). Accepts the legacy `dpa_config` section name; legacy inline `mqtt_endpoint`, `mqtt_broker_port`, `hb_interval`, and `auth` keys are migrated into `svpc` at load time with a deprecation warning. |
| `dsx_exchange_event_bus` | `Option<DsxExchangeEventBusConfig>` | — | `integrations` | MQTT event bus for managed-host state publishing plus BMS metadata subscription and rack/isolation/heartbeat publishing (see [DsxExchangeEventBusConfig](#dsxexchangeeventbusconfig)). |
| `datacenter_asn` | `u32` | `11414` | `networking` | Datacenter ASN used by FNN for DC-specific route targets. |
| `nvlink_config` | `Option<NvLinkConfig>` | — | `hardware` | NvLink partitioning via NMX-C (see [NvLinkConfig](#nvlinkconfig)). |
| `power_manager_options` | `PowerManagerOptions` | *(see below)* | `hardware` | Power management timing (see [PowerManagerOptions](#powermanageroptions)). |
| `sitename` | `Option<String>` | — | `server` | Human-readable site name exposed to tenants via FMDS. |
| `auto_machine_repair_plugin` | `AutoMachineRepairPluginConfig` | *(default)* | `machines` | Auto-repair configuration for failed machines. |
| `vmaas_config` | `Option<VmaasConfig>` | — | `integrations` | VMaaS configuration for VM system integration (see [VmaasConfig](#vmaasconfig)). |
| `mlxconfig_profiles` | `Option<HashMap<String, MlxConfigProfile>>` | — | `machines` | Named Mellanox NIC register configuration profiles for superNIC firmware flashing. TOML key: `mlx-config-profiles`. |
| `rms` | `RmsConfig` | *(see below)* | `hardware` | Rack Manager Service configuration for API connectivity and mTLS (see [RmsConfig](#rmsconfig)). |
| `rack_profiles` | `RackProfileConfig` | *(default)* | `hardware` | Rack profile definitions referenced by expected racks. |
| `spdm` | `SpdmConfig` | *(see below)* | `security` | SPDM hardware attestation (see [SpdmConfig](#spdmconfig)). |
| `bgp_leaf_session_password` | `Option<BgpLeafSessionPassword>` | — | `networking` | Selects the credential source for leaf-facing BGP session passwords returned to agents in managed host network config. Supported value: `site_wide`. |
| `site_global_vpc_vni` | `Option<u32>` | — | `networking` | Forces all VRFs to share a single VNI (Cumulus Linux route-leaking workaround). Limits DPU to one VRF. |
| `dpf` | `DpfConfig` | *(see below)* | `machines` | DPF (DPU Platform Framework) Kubernetes deployment (see [DpfConfig](#dpfconfig)). |
| `x86_pxe_boot_url_override` | `Option<String>` | — | `machines` | Override PXE boot URL for x86 machines. |
| `arm_pxe_boot_url_override` | `Option<String>` | — | `machines` | Override PXE boot URL for ARM machines. |
| `pxe_public_base_url` | `String` | `http://carbide-pxe.forge:8080` | `machines` | Canonical PXE base URL. |
| `set_http_boot_uri_for_vendors` | `Vec<BMCVendor>` | `[]` | `machines` | Vendors for which the state controller pins the UEFI HTTP boot URL on the BMC via Redfish `HttpBootUri`. Empty = all machines rely on nico-dhcp option 67 for the URL. |
| `compute_allocation_enforcement` | `ComputeAllocationEnforcement` | `WarnOnly` | `machines` | Controls enforcement of compute allocations on new instance requests. |
| `supernic_firmware_profiles` | nested `HashMap` | `{}` | `machines` | SuperNIC firmware profiles keyed by `part_number` then `PSID`. |
| `component_manager` | `Option<ComponentManagerConfig>` | — | `hardware` | Component manager for NvLink switches and power shelves. |
| `vpcs` | `Option<HashMap<String, VpcDefinition>>` | — | `networking` | VPCs to create at startup (see [VpcDefinition](#vpcdefinition)). Use the `CreateVpc` gRPC to create them later instead. |
| `allow_bmc_basic_auth_fallback` | `bool` | `false` | `security` | When `true`, `GetBmcCredentials` may return `UsernamePassword` credentials for BMCs whose Redfish ServiceRoot does not expose `SessionService`. When `false`, such BMCs surface a `NoSessionService` error and no basic-auth fallback is performed. |
| `rack_validation_config` | `RackValidationConfig` | *(default)* | `hardware` | Rack-level validation: multi-node partition tests after firmware upgrade and maintenance to verify rack health (see [RackValidationConfig](#rackvalidationconfig)). |
| `oem_manager_profiles` | `BiosProfileVendor` | `{}` | `machines` | Vendor-specific iDRAC/BMC manager attributes applied during machine setup, before BMC lockdown. Keyed by vendor → model → profile → attribute name; targets the manager OEM attributes endpoint (e.g. Dell `DellAttributes`), as opposed to `bios_profiles` which targets BIOS settings. Model names are normalized to lowercase with underscores (e.g. `"PowerEdge R760"` → `"poweredge_r760"`). |
| `external_api_url` | `Option<String>` | — | `server` | Alternate API URL for external hosts that cannot resolve the internal name, e.g. `https://carbide-stack-api.corp.example.com`. Handed to interfaces on the static-assignments subnet; unset means external hosts get the internal `api_url`. |
| `external_pxe_url` | `Option<String>` | — | `machines` | Alternate PXE URL for external hosts. Used for cloud-init and root CA retrieval on the static-assignments segment; same rules as `external_api_url`. |
| `external_static_pxe_url` | `Option<String>` | — | `machines` | Alternate static PXE URL for kernel/blob downloads on the static-assignments segment. Falls back to `external_pxe_url`. |
| `default_tenant_routing_profile_type` | `String` | `EXTERNAL` | `networking` | The default routing profile used when a tenant is created. |
| `initial_objects_file` | `Option<PathBuf>` | — | `server` | Path to the `initial_objects.toml` file for seeding the database. |
| `enable_admin_ui` | `bool` | `true` | `server` | Whether to serve the admin web UI (the HTML pages under `/admin`). Set to `false` to run only the gRPC API; the gRPC service is unaffected either way. |
| `web_ui_sidebar_tools` | `Vec<ToolLink>` | `[]` | `server` | External tool links surfaced in the admin web UI's "Tools" sidebar. Each entry's `name` must be unique; the section is hidden when the list is empty. |
| `web_ui_logs_link_template` | `String` | `""` | `server` | URL template for the "Logs" link on machine and endpoint detail pages. The placeholder `{search}` is replaced with the machine ID or BMC IP. When empty, the link is hidden. |
| `log_history` | `LogHistoryConfig` | *(default)* | `integrations` | In-memory log history for the admin web live log viewer at `/admin/logs` (see [LogHistoryConfig](#loghistoryconfig)). |
| `tracing` | `TracingConfig` | *(default)* | `integrations` | OTLP trace export settings (see [TracingConfig](#tracingconfig)). |
| `secrets` | `Option<SecretsConfig>` | — | `security` | Secrets backend configuration. When present, the credential reader chain and write target are operator-configured (see [SecretsConfig](#secretsconfig)). |
| `credentials` | `CredentialsConfig` | *(default)* | `security` | Operator-managed static credential sources and the UFM read/mutation policy (see [CredentialsConfig](#credentialsconfig)). The config stores source locations, not credential values. |
| `dhcp_lease_expiry_handling` | `bool` | `false` | `networking` | Enables IP cleanup when a DHCP lease expires. |
| `certificates` | `CertificatesConfig` | *(default)* | `security` | Certificate vending backend, selected independently of the credential store; the default shares the credential Vault (see [CertificatesConfig](#certificatesconfig)). |
| `allow_insecure_discovery` | `bool` | `false` | `machines` | Allows machines to submit discovery without enforcing the request comes from the expected IP address. Needed for *Integration tests only*, should otherwise not be used. |
| `scout_boot_interface_correction_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | `machines` | Controls whether NICo may reconcile a boot interface selection recorded as `RedfishChassisId` or `RedfishSerialNumber` after ordering DPU-attached Admin interfaces by the `domain:bus:device.function` PCI addresses in scout's `HardwareInfo`. The setting is read at startup. NICo records available comparisons in structured logs and `carbide_scout_pci_evaluations_total` regardless of this setting. When `false`, it does not change the selection. When `true`, reconciliation requires at least two eligible interfaces, a complete and unique candidate, `ManagedHostState::Ready` or `ManagedHostState::HostInit` with `MachineState::Discovered`, no `Instance` or primary interface prediction, and no conflicting or integrated-NIC primary. If the selected MAC is already desired and primary, NICo changes only the source to `ScoutReportPci`. Otherwise it updates the desired target and primary together and enqueues the state handler. A `Ready` host enters `BootConfiguring`; `HostInit` completes its reboot handshake first. |
| `node_auth` | `NodeAuthConfig` | *(default)* | `security` | How Scout and the DPU-agent authenticate: bearer JWTs, machine mTLS client certificates, or both during a migration (see [NodeAuthConfig](#nodeauthconfig)). |

---

### Component Manager RMS Node Descriptors

When `[component_manager]` uses RMS backends, NICo builds RMS node descriptors
from rack profiles. Each descriptor contains three attributes:

- Role from the component-manager operation: `compute`, `switch`, or
  `power_shelf`.
- Product family from `product_family`, which must be non-empty for RMS-backed
  operations. NICo passes other non-empty product-family identifiers to RMS
  without a local hardware mapping.
- Vendor from `rack_capabilities.<role>.vendor` for each role using an RMS
  backend.

NICo always sends these attributes in descriptor-based RMS requests. For exact
role, vendor, and product-family combinations represented by the current RMS
`NodeType` enum, NICo also sends that enum and legacy firmware-filter entries
for compatibility with older RMS servers. Other combinations leave `NodeType`
unset and require RMS support for `NodeDescriptor`. This best-effort legacy
mapping does not participate in startup validation. In particular, VRNVL72
power shelves use their configured VRNVL72 descriptor because no matching
legacy `NodeType` exists.

NICo validates configured rack profiles at startup when any component-manager
backend is set to `rms`. The component-manager backend fields default to `rms`,
so deployments that only want one RMS role must explicitly set the other backend
fields to non-RMS values. Startup validation checks the product family and only
the vendor fields for enabled RMS roles. For example, if only
`power_shelf_backend = "rms"` after the other backend fields are set to non-RMS
values, then only `rack_capabilities.power_shelf.vendor` is required as a vendor
field.

NICo trims outer whitespace from `product_family` and vendor values and requires
both to be non-empty. It does not validate either value against a fixed list.
RMS determines whether each role/vendor/product-family combination is supported
when a request is made. Refer to the
[Hardware Compatibility List](https://docs.nvidia.com/rms/documentation/reference/hardware-compatibility-list)
as a compatibility reference. The list includes hardware under development, and
inclusion does not imply qualification, certification, or support. Confirm
support for each combination against the deployed RMS release.

For product families other than `gb200` and `gb300`, the `GetRackProfile`
`product_family` enum is `UNSPECIFIED`. The configured string remains available
to descriptor-based RMS operations.

Each `rack_capabilities.<role>` section also requires a `count` field. This
field is independent of RMS: it tells the rack state machine how many devices
with that role the rack must have before it can progress. A rack stays in
`Created` until all three roles have at least `count` devices registered; it
stays in `Discovering` until all three roles have at least `count` devices in
`Ready` state. All three roles — `compute`, `switch`, and `power_shelf` —
require a `count` regardless of which backends are set to `rms`. The third
example below shows `count` on `compute` and `switch` even though those roles
use non-RMS backends.

The examples below only show the component-manager and rack-profile fields.
Configure `[rms]` separately when NICo needs to call RMS.
The `nsm` and `psm` backend values require externally managed services; the
NICo deployment charts do not install NSM or PSM.

Example: GB200 rack where all component-manager roles use RMS:

```toml
[component_manager]
compute_tray_backend = "rms"
nv_switch_backend = "rms"
power_shelf_backend = "rms"

[rack_profiles.NVL72]
product_family = "gb200"
rack_hardware_topology = "gb200_nvl72r1_c2g4_topology"

[rack_profiles.NVL72.firmware_object]
url = "https://firmware.example.com/objects/nvl72.json"
fetch_timeout = "30s"
access_token_credential = "nvl72-artifacts"

[rack_profiles.NVL72.rack_capabilities.compute]
vendor = "NVIDIA"
count = 18

[rack_profiles.NVL72.rack_capabilities.switch]
vendor = "NVIDIA"
count = 9

[rack_profiles.NVL72.rack_capabilities.power_shelf]
vendor = "LiteOn"
count = 8
```

`firmware_object` supplies the SOT JSON for automatic rack firmware and switch
NVOS image updates and for automatic compute-tray firmware updates during
pre-ingestion. When `firmware_object` is configured for a profile with switches,
the document must include an NVOS image whose firmware type matches
`rack_hardware_class`. NICo requests `prod` when `rack_hardware_class` is
omitted. RMS records an asynchronous update failure when the document does not
contain the required image. If `firmware_object` is omitted, NICo skips both
automatic rack maintenance phases and the compute-tray pre-ingestion update. An
explicit maintenance request can supply a firmware object instead. If no
firmware object is available while a selected switch is in
`WaitingForNVOSUpgrade` for a reprovision request whose initiator is
`rack-{rack_id}`, the rack transitions to `Error` instead of skipping the NVOS
phase. `fetch_timeout` defaults to `30s`.

`access_token_credential` optionally names a credential that contains a
firmware artifact access token. NICo reads the secret when compute-tray
pre-ingestion starts. When the field is omitted, NICo sends the RMS no-auth
sentinel.

Example: GB300 rack with NVIDIA compute trays and Delta power shelves:

```toml
[component_manager]
compute_tray_backend = "rms"
nv_switch_backend = "rms"
power_shelf_backend = "rms"

[rack_profiles.NVL72_GB300]
product_family = "gb300"
rack_hardware_topology = "gb300_nvl72r1_c2g4_topology"

[rack_profiles.NVL72_GB300.rack_capabilities.compute]
vendor = "NVIDIA"
count = 18

[rack_profiles.NVL72_GB300.rack_capabilities.switch]
vendor = "nvidia"
count = 9

[rack_profiles.NVL72_GB300.rack_capabilities.power_shelf]
vendor = "delta"
count = 6
```

Example: only the component-manager power shelf backend uses RMS. The compute
and switch component-manager backends are explicitly set to non-RMS values, so
component-manager startup validation only requires the power shelf vendor field:

```toml
[component_manager]
compute_tray_backend = "core"
nv_switch_backend = "nsm"
power_shelf_backend = "rms"

[component_manager.nsm]
url = "http://nsm.example.internal:50052"

[rack_profiles.NVL72_POWER]
product_family = "gb200"
rack_hardware_topology = "gb200_nvl72r1_c2g4_topology"

[rack_profiles.NVL72_POWER.rack_capabilities.compute]
count = 18

[rack_profiles.NVL72_POWER.rack_capabilities.switch]
count = 9

[rack_profiles.NVL72_POWER.rack_capabilities.power_shelf]
vendor = "Lite-On"
count = 8
```

Each rack that uses an RMS-backed operation must have a `rack_profile_id`
matching a key under `[rack_profiles]`. Startup validation does not scan
existing rack database rows, so missing or unknown per-rack profile IDs are
still checked when an RMS operation runs.

The separate site-explorer machine-ingestion RMS slot/tray lookup also uses the
rack profile to build a compute node descriptor. If that path is enabled for
machines with rack IDs, the profile also needs compute product-family and vendor
data even when `compute_tray_backend` is not `rms`.

NICo accepts non-empty product-family strings. RMS evaluates descriptor support
when an operation runs. The optional `rack_hardware_topology` field remains
available for topology-specific flows.

## Sub-Structs

### `BmcProxyConfig` — `bmc_proxy`

Routes `nico-api` BMC Redfish traffic through `nico-bmc-proxy`. The proxy
authenticates upstream itself, so clients from the proxied pools carry no BMC
credentials.

The proxied pools handle:

- Machine-lifecycle Redfish traffic.
- Credentialed exploration for endpoints with established stored root
  credentials. The proxy resolves the same per-BMC credential key.

Some traffic remains on the direct pools:

- Every exploration cycle starts with a direct anonymous service-root probe
  because vendor detection has no proxy path.
- The power-shelf vendor fallback authenticates directly.
- Component-manager compute-tray power control—the `core` compute-tray
  backend and standalone servers—uses explicit per-endpoint credentials.
- Credential-subject operations remain direct: first-contact exploration,
  credential setup with factory or expected credentials, BMC session minting,
  password rotation, and UEFI password management.

The proxied pool rejects explicit credentials, so a misrouted request returns
an error. The proxy presents a verifiable certificate, and connections to it
keep certificate verification enabled.

Keep these constraints in mind:

- **Precedence.** This static section is independent of the dynamic
  `site_explorer.bmc_proxy` development redirect configured by the
  `set bmc-proxy` CLI command. The proxied pool ignores the dynamic redirect,
  and the admin Redfish passthrough uses this section when both are configured.
  The dynamic redirect continues to apply to clients from the direct pools.
- **Basic authentication.** For BMCs without a `SessionService`, the proxy
  uses HTTP Basic authentication. `GetBmcCredentials` provides these
  credentials only when `allow_bmc_basic_auth_fallback` is enabled.
  Otherwise, the BMC is unreachable through the proxied pool.
- **Port.** `nico-bmc-proxy` always connects to the BMC through the standard
  HTTPS port, 443. A BMC recorded with another Redfish port returns a
  client-creation error that identifies the unsupported port.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Master switch for routing through `nico-bmc-proxy`. When `false`, traffic uses the direct pools; the independent dynamic `site_explorer.bmc_proxy` redirect remains in effect. |
| `address` | `String` | `""` | Proxy address as `host:port` or `host` (the port defaults to the BMC proxy's 1079). Required when `enabled` is true; startup fails on an enabled section with an empty `address`. |
| `client_cert` | `String` | `/var/run/secrets/spiffe.io/tls.crt` | PEM client certificate presented to the proxy's mTLS listener. |
| `client_key` | `String` | `/var/run/secrets/spiffe.io/tls.key` | PEM private key for `client_cert`. |
| `root_ca` | `String` | `/var/run/secrets/spiffe.io/ca.crt` | PEM bundle that verifies the proxy's server certificate. |

#### Certificate lifecycle

`client_cert`, `client_key`, and `root_ca` are read from disk, so certificate
rotation is picked up without a restart:

- The proxied Redfish pool and the admin passthrough client read the files at
  startup, and an unreadable file fails startup. Each rebuilds its TLS client
  from disk on the first request after a five-minute interval. A failed rebuild
  keeps the previous client in service, increments
  `carbide_api_bmc_proxy_client_reload_failures_total`, and defers the next
  attempt until another five-minute interval has passed.
- The nv-redfish proxied pool that site-explorer uses builds its client on
  first use and rebuilds it at most once per five-minute interval, off the
  request path. A failed rebuild keeps the previous client and logs a warning.
  Until a first client exists, every request retries the build and returns the
  read error.

Rotate so that the outgoing certificate stays valid for at least five minutes
after the new files are written, and alert on the reload-failure counter: a
persistent failure means proxied BMC traffic stops when the stale certificate
expires.

### `ApiAdmissionControlConfig`

Admission control places each authenticated client in its own bounded FIFO and
schedules those clients fairly within the global execution and pending-request
budgets. The default per-client limits apply to external users, SPIFFE machines,
SPIFFE services without an override, and requests without a recognized client
identity. An exact SPIFFE service override can give a trusted internal service a
different share without allowing it to exceed either global bound.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `true` | Enable fair, bounded API admission. When `false`, admission is bypassed and the other fields in this section are not validated. |
| `max_work_in_flight` | `usize` | `64` | Maximum business requests executing concurrently. When enabled, must be greater than zero and no greater than `tokio::sync::Semaphore::MAX_PERMITS`. |
| `max_pending` | `usize` | `1024` | Maximum business requests waiting for execution. When enabled, must be greater than zero and no greater than `tokio::sync::Semaphore::MAX_PERMITS`. |
| `max_work_in_flight_per_client` | `usize` | `8` | Default maximum business requests from one client that may execute concurrently. Must be greater than zero, no greater than `max_work_in_flight`, and representable as a `u32`. |
| `max_pending_per_client` | `usize` | `64` | Default hard bound on pending business requests from one client. Must be greater than zero and no greater than `max_pending`. |
| `pending_timeout` | `Duration` | `5s` | Default maximum time a client's pending request may wait for execution. Admission can reject earlier when its queue-delay estimate exceeds this value. Must be greater than zero. |
| `client_idle_timeout` | `Duration` | `5m` | How long an empty, inactive client's scheduler state is cached before cleanup. Must be greater than zero. |
| `service_limits` | `BTreeMap<String, ApiAdmissionServiceLimitsConfig>` | `{}` | Per-service overrides keyed by the exact SPIFFE service identifier described below. Unlisted services use the default per-client limits. |

#### `ApiAdmissionServiceLimitsConfig`

Every field is required for each service override; the nested structure has no
field-level defaults.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `max_work_in_flight` | `usize` | **required** | Maximum requests from this service that may execute concurrently. Must be greater than zero, no greater than the global `max_work_in_flight`, and representable as a `u32`. |
| `max_pending` | `usize` | **required** | Hard bound on this service's pending requests. Must be greater than zero and no greater than the global `max_pending`. |
| `pending_timeout` | `Duration` | **required** | Maximum time this service's pending request may wait for execution. Admission can reject earlier when its queue-delay estimate exceeds this value. Must be greater than zero. |

The map key is the identifier extracted by removing one of
`auth.trust.spiffe_service_base_paths` from the certificate's SPIFFE path. For
example, a SPIFFE path `/forge-system/sa/scout` with base path
`/forge-system/sa/` has service identifier `scout`:

```toml
[api_admission_control.service_limits.scout]
max_work_in_flight = 16
max_pending = 128
pending_timeout = "5s"
```

Matching is exact and case-sensitive. Keys are not trimmed, expanded as
prefixes, or interpreted as globs. Configure `scout`, not the full SPIFFE URI
and not the rendered principal `spiffe-service-id/scout`. An override key must
contain at least one non-whitespace character. Quote a TOML key when the
extracted identifier contains characters such as `/` or `.`.

### `TlsConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `root_cafile_path` | `String` | `""` | Root CA certificate for client validation. |
| `identity_pemfile_path` | `String` | `""` | Server identity certificate PEM. |
| `identity_keyfile_path` | `String` | `""` | Server identity private key. |
| `admin_root_cafile_path` | `String` | `""` | Admin root CA for admin client validation. |

### `NodeAuthConfig`

Node (Scout / DPU-agent) authentication. Bearer tokens are off by default, so
the default is machine mTLS exactly as before. See
`docs/design/machine-identity/node-auth-jwt.md`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Accept `Authorization: Bearer` node JWTs. Nodes self-sign these with their existing mTLS client-certificate key and carry the certificate in the token's `x5c` header; the API verifies it against `[tls] root_cafile_path`. Requires a TLS listener -- the API refuses to accept bearer tokens over plaintext. |
| `mtls_enabled` | `bool` | `true` | Accept machine mTLS client certificates as node identity. Turn off only once the fleet presents bearer tokens; startup fails if this and `enabled` are both false. Scoped to machine certificates -- service and admin-CLI certificates are unaffected. Requires a TLS listener to mean anything: a plaintext `listen_mode` presents no peer certificates, so this silently authenticates nobody. |
| `max_token_ttl_sec` | `u32` | `900` | Longest accepted token lifetime, in seconds. Clients mint 300 s tokens; this caps how far a client may push `exp`. Must be greater than zero and at most 86400. |
| `fmds_use_node_tokens` | `Option<bool>` | *(unset)* | Whether DPF-deployed fmds is rendered in token mode. Unset follows `enabled`, which is what almost every site wants. Set it to `false` while `enabled` is still `true` to move fmds back to client certificates *first* -- the supported way to stage a disable, since the API stops accepting tokens the moment it restarts while fmds keeps presenting them until DPF has rolled every DaemonSet. `true` with `enabled = false` is refused at startup. |

Both mechanisms need `listen_mode = "tls"`. Bearer tokens are refused over
plaintext explicitly, at startup; machine mTLS simply has no certificates to
inspect, because a plaintext listener hands the middleware an empty peer-cert
list. The `enabled = false` + `mtls_enabled = false` lockout check therefore
guarantees a working node-auth path *only on a TLS listener* -- on plaintext,
`mtls_enabled = true` satisfies the check while authenticating nobody. No
shipped configuration selects a plaintext mode.

### `AuthConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `permissive_mode` | `bool` | — | Enable permissive authorization (dev mode). |
| `casbin_policy_file` | `Option<PathBuf>` | — | Path to Casbin CSV policy file. |
| `cli_certs` | `Option<AllowedCertCriteria>` | — | Additional allowed cert criteria for nico-admin-cli. |
| `trust` | `Option<TrustConfig>` | — | SPIFFE trust domain and allowed paths for client certs. |

### `IBFabricConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enables InfiniBand fabric management. |
| `max_partition_per_tenant` | `i32` | `31` | Maximum IB partitions per tenant (1-31). |
| `allow_insecure` | `bool` | `false` | Allow insecure fabric configs that skip tenant isolation. |
| `mtu` | `IBMtu` | *(default)* | MTU for IB fabric traffic. |
| `rate_limit` | `IBRateLimit` | *(default)* | Rate limit for IB traffic. |
| `service_level` | `IBServiceLevel` | *(default)* | QoS service level for IB packets. |
| `fabric_monitor_run_interval` | `Duration` | `60s` | Interval for the IB fabric monitor. |

### `NvLinkConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `true` | Enables NvLink partitioning. Also `true` when `nvlink_config` is omitted. |
| `monitor_run_interval` | `Duration` | `60s` | NvLink monitor polling interval. |
| `nmx_c_tls_ca_cert_path` | `Option<String>` | — | Extra CA bundle for verifying the NMX-C server over HTTPS. |
| `nmx_c_tls_client_cert_path` | `Option<String>` | — | Client certificate for mTLS to NMX-C. |
| `nmx_c_tls_client_key_path` | `Option<String>` | — | Client private key for mTLS to NMX-C. |
| `nmx_c_tls_authority` | `Option<String>` | — | TLS server name used for SNI and certificate verification. |
| `allow_insecure` | `bool` | `false` | Skip TLS verification for NMX-C. |

When `enabled` is `true`, `allow_insecure` is `false`, and none of the four
`nmx_c_tls_*` keys is set, `nico-api` checks at startup for
`/var/run/secrets/nvswitch-client/tls.crt` and `tls.key` (the Helm chart's
`nvSwitchTls.nicoClient` mount). If both exist, it uses them as the client
certificate, uses `ca.crt` from the same directory or else
`/var/run/secrets/nico-roots/ca.crt` as the CA bundle, and sets
`nmx_c_tls_authority` to `initial_domain_name`. Setting any `nmx_c_tls_*` key
disables these defaults, and unset keys keep their documented behavior.
| `nmx_c_endpoint_port` | `Option<u16>` | — | TCP port for NMX-C endpoints derived from switch NVOS IP. Unset uses the production NMX-C port. |
| `nmx_c_certificate_rotation` | `NmxCCertificateRotationConfig` | *(default)* | Optional expiry-driven rotation for NMX-C server certificates. |
| `partition_monitor_max_concurrent_groups` | `NonZeroUsize` | `16` | Maximum number of NMX-C machine groups (chassis or rack) processed concurrently per monitor iteration. Bounds DB pool usage and gRPC fan-out. Must be ≥ 1. |

### `NmxCCertificateRotationConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enables NMX-C server certificate expiry checks and rotation. |
| `run_interval` | `Duration` | `1h` | Interval between checks of the certificate served by NMX-C. |
| `rotate_before_expiry` | `Duration` | `1w` | Requests rotation when the served certificate expires within this duration. Must leave enough time for the replacement certificate to be issued first. |
| `probe_timeout` | `Duration` | `10s` | Timeout for each NMX-C certificate probe operation. |

`expiry_warning_window` remains accepted as a deprecated alias for
`rotate_before_expiry`; its value now controls rotation rather than warning only.

### `SiteExplorerConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `true` | Enables hardware discovery. |
| `run_interval` | `Duration` | `120s` | Interval between exploration runs. |
| `concurrent_explorations` | `u64` | `100` | Max nodes explored in parallel. |
| `explorations_per_run` | `u64` | `360` | Max nodes explored per run. |
| `create_machines` | `bool` | `true` | When false, SiteExplorer skips creating ManagedHost state machines; the DPU agent (scout) must self-register via DiscoverMachine gRPC endpoint with create_machine=true. Dynamically toggleable. |
| `machines_created_per_run` | `u64` | `100` | Max ManagedHosts created per run. |
| `rotate_switch_nvos_credentials` | `bool` | `false` | Auto-rotate switch NVOS admin credentials. |
| `override_target_ip` | `Option<String>` | — | **Deprecated.** Use `bmc_proxy`. Debug BMC IP override. |
| `override_target_port` | `Option<u16>` | — | **Deprecated.** Use `bmc_proxy`. Debug BMC port override. |
| `bmc_proxy` | `HostPortPair` | — | BMC proxy host:port for integration testing/dev. |
| `allow_changing_bmc_proxy` | `Option<bool>` | *(auto)* | Allow runtime changes to `bmc_proxy`. Auto-detected from initial config. |
| `reset_rate_limit` | `Duration` | `1h` | Minimum time between SiteExplorer-initiated BMC resets. |
| `admin_segment_type_non_dpu` | `bool` | `false` | Non-DPU hosts use `HostInband` admin segment type. |
| `create_power_shelves` | `bool` | `true` | Auto-create Power Shelf state machines for explored shelves with a matching `expected_power_shelves` record. Shelves are discovered at their `expected_power_shelves` static IP even without a DHCP lease. |
| `power_shelves_created_per_run` | `u64` | `1` | Max power shelves created per run. |
| `create_switches` | `bool` | `true` | Auto-create Switch state machines for explored switches with a matching `expected_switches` record. |
| `switches_created_per_run` | `u64` | `9` | Max switches created per run. |
| `explore_mode` | `SiteExplorerExploreMode` | `NvRedfish` | Redfish backend: `libredfish`, `nv-redfish`, or `compare-result`. |
| `dpu_policy` | `Option<HostDpuPolicy>` | — (effective: `manage`) | Site-wide policy for DPU hardware: `manage`, `nic`, or `ignore`. Per-host `nic` and `ignore` override it; per-host `manage` inherits it for backward compatibility. When omitted, the site default is `manage`. The previous `use_as_nic` value and the legacy `dpu_mode` field with `dpu_mode` / `nic_mode` / `no_dpu` values remain accepted during deserialization. |

### `StateControllerConfig`

Shared by all `*StateControllerConfig` structs (machine, network segment, VPC prefix, extension
service, IB partition, DPA interface, rack, power shelf, switch, SPDM).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `iteration_time` | `Duration` | `30s` | Target duration for one state controller iteration. |
| `max_object_handling_time` | `Duration` | `3m` | Shared budget for claiming queued objects and evaluating/advancing each object's state, starting before claim connection acquisition and including commit and dispatch. A late claim starts no tasks; a late handler returns `StateHandlerError::Timeout`. Abandoned reservations become eligible again after three times this duration. |
| `max_concurrency` | `usize` | `10` | Max objects advanced in parallel. |
| `processor_dispatch_interval` | `Duration` | `2s` | Max wait time when checking for and dispatching new tasks. |
| `processor_log_interval` | `Duration` | `60s` | How often the processor emits log messages. |
| `metric_emission_interval` | `Duration` | `60s` | How often aggregate metrics are recalculated. |
| `metric_hold_time` | `Duration` | `5m` | How long per-object metrics are held before eviction. |

### `RackStateControllerConfig`

TOML section: `[rack_state_controller]`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `controller` | `StateControllerConfig` | *(default)* | Common state controller timing (see [StateControllerConfig](#statecontrollerconfig)). |
| `nmx_cluster_switch_mtls_services` | `Vec<SwitchMtlsService>` | N/A (ignored) | **Deprecated.** Accepted and ignored. Rack `ConfigureNmxCluster` uses a fixed `nvue_api` binding before RMS V2 selects and configures the primary switch. |

### `SwitchStateControllerConfig`

TOML section: `[switch_state_controller]`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `controller` | `StateControllerConfig` | *(default)* | Common state controller timing (see [StateControllerConfig](#statecontrollerconfig)). |
| `switch_mtls_services` | `Vec<SwitchMtlsService>` | all four values below | mTLS certificate bindings applied by switch state-controller operations and direct `ComponentConfigureSwitchCertificate` RPC calls. A non-empty list replaces the default. Omission and `[]` both use the default. |

`switch_mtls_services` accepts these RMS service values:

| Value | RMS service description |
|-------|-------------------------|
| `nvue_api` | NVUE REST API service |
| `scale_up_fabric_telemetry` | Scale-up fabric telemetry service |
| `scale_up_fabric_manager` | Scale-up fabric manager service |
| `scale_up_fabric_telemetry_interface` | Scale-up fabric telemetry interface service |

`switch_mtls_services` selects server-side certificate bindings. It does not
enable the underlying service. For workflow scope, see
[Switch Certificate Configuration](https://docs.nvidia.com/infra-controller/documentation/architecture/state-machines/switch-certificate-configuration).

### `ObservabilityConfig`

TOML section: `[observability]`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `per_object_metrics_for_classifications` | `Vec<HealthAlertClassification>` | `[]` | Health alert classifications for which the per-object metric `carbide_object_unhealthy_by_classification_count` is emitted, labeled with `object_type` (e.g. `machine`, `switch`, `rack`, `power_shelf`) and `object_id`. Each entry adds up to one extra time series per matching object, so it defaults to empty (disabled) to keep metric cardinality bounded. When empty, the metric is not registered or exposed at all; aggregate health metrics are unaffected regardless. |
| `per_object_state_metrics` | `PerObjectStateMetricsConfig` | disabled | High-cardinality per-object state, SLA, manual-intervention, trait, and association metrics served from a dedicated listener. |

### `PerObjectStateMetricsConfig`

TOML section: `[observability.per_object_state_metrics]`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Registers per-object state metrics and starts the dedicated listener. When `object_types` is empty, registration and the listener are both skipped even if this is `true`. |
| `listen_address` | `SocketAddr` | `[::]:9091` | Dual-stack address serving `/metrics`; the Helm chart derives it from `service.perObjectStateMetrics.port`. |
| `object_types` | `Vec<PerObjectStateMetricObjectType>` | all supported types | Types to publish: `machine`, `switch`, `power_shelf`, `rack`, `network_segment`, `vpc_prefix`, `spdm_attestation`, and/or `ib_partition`. An empty list publishes no state series and skips the dedicated listener. |

### `MachineStateControllerConfig`

Extends `StateControllerConfig` with:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `dpu_wait_time` | `Duration` | `5m` | Time before a DPU is considered definitively down. |
| `power_down_wait` | `Duration` | `2m` | Wait after power-down before powering on. |
| `failure_retry_time` | `Duration` | `90m` | Time before re-triggering reboot if machine hasn't called back. |
| `dpu_up_threshold` | `Duration` | `5m` | Max time without DPU health report before assuming it's down. |
| `scout_reporting_timeout` | `Duration` | `5m` | Duration without scout report before host is unhealthy. |
| `waiting_for_measurements_timeout` | `Duration` | `4h` | How long a host may remain in WaitingForMeasurements before being escalated to Failed. |
| `uefi_boot_wait` | `Duration` | `5m` | Wait time for UEFI boot completion after host reboot. |
| `max_bios_config_retries` | `u32` | `3` | Shared retry budget for automated host boot-configuration convergence across BIOS recovery and boot-order verification. |
| `polling_bios_setup_stuck_threshold` | `Duration` | `15m` | Time in PollingBiosSetup with `is_bios_setup == false` before recovery escalation. |
| `boot_interface_observation_interval` | `Duration` | `10m` | Positive time between successful Redfish observations of an already-verified boot interface. |
| `controller` | `StateControllerConfig` | *(default)* | Common state controller timing (see [StateControllerConfig](#statecontrollerconfig)). |

The Redfish observation is read-only. A successful match refreshes the last
observation timestamp. A mismatch records a new pending generation for the same
desired target: Ready enters the existing boot-configuration flow on its next
controller sweep, while Assigned defers remediation until release. Failed reads
and skipped observations preserve the last successful observation and retry on
a later controller iteration.

The controller skips periodic observation for locked Supermicro hosts because
their reported boot-order view remains stale until lockdown is disabled and the
host is rebooted. Profiles configured with `disable_lockdown = true` use the
normal observation path.

| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `instance_autoreboot_period` | `Option<TimePeriod>` | — | UTC time window for automatic machine reboots. |
| `max_concurrent_machine_updates_absolute` | `Option<i32>` | — | Hard cap on concurrent machine updates. |
| `max_concurrent_machine_updates_percent` | `Option<i32>` | — | Percentage cap on concurrent updates (lesser of absolute/percent is used). |

### `PowerManagerOptions`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |

| `wait_duration_until_host_reboot` | `Duration` | `15m` | Wait after power-down before powering on host. |

### `VmaasConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `allow_instance_vf` | `bool` | `true` | Global instance-VF admission switch for creation and network updates. `false` rejects every VF. For a DPF-managed host with intercept topology, `true` additionally requires every requested VF ID to be explicitly selected by that topology. A DPF-managed host without intercept topology preserves the historical boolean-only admission behavior. Admission for a non-DPF host additionally requires the VF to be present in the effective `hbn_reps` and `dpu_config.num_of_vfs` inventory. |
| `hbn_reps` | `Option<String>` | — | Comma-separated representors HBN is expected to use during DPU provisioning. For non-DPF instance admission, `pf0vfN` entries and inclusive `pf0vfN-pf0vfM` ranges select tenant VFs, capped by `dpu_config.num_of_vfs`; other representors do not select tenant VFs. Omitted or empty values use HBN's VF0 through VF13 fallback. Malformed PF0 VF selectors cause instance creation and network updates to fail validation. DPF-managed hosts ignore this field for admission. |
| `bridging` | `Option<HostRepresentorBridgingConfig>` | — | Provisioning-time topology for bridges inserted between host representors and HBN or DPF's `br-sfc`. Under DPF, a present `vmaas_config` makes this map the complete configurable PF/VF inventory and requires exactly one PF entry. |

### `HostRepresentorBridgingConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `hbn_bridge` | `String` | `"br-hbn"` | HBN/SFC bridge that host-representor patch ports attach to during BlueField provisioning. |
| `host_representor_intercept_bridging` | `HashMap<String, HostInterceptBridging>` | `{}` | Host-owned PF/VF representor bridge layout keyed by the legacy representor name. Non-skipped entries are sent to pre-DPF BlueField provisioning as `<representor>:<bridge>:<patch_port>`. When DPF is enabled, this map replaces the static PF/VF inventory; an absent map, empty map, or VF-only map is rejected because FMDS requires the selected PF. |

### `HostInterceptBridging`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `bridge` | `String` | **required** | Bridge that sits between the host PF/VF representor and br-hbn or br-sfc. |
| `patch_port` | `String` | **required** | Patch port on this bridge that connects it toward HBN or SFC. |
| `skip_create` | `bool` | `false` | When true, the entry is omitted from provisioning-time bridge creation. |
| `dpf_interface` | `Option<DpfInterfaceIdentity>` | — | Typed DPF PF/VF selection. Optional and ignored by pre-DPF provisioning, but required for every map entry when DPF is enabled. The surrounding legacy map key is never parsed as DPF identity. |

When DPF is enabled, `skip_create=true` is rejected. `bridge` is a Linux netdev name and must contain 1–15 lowercase ASCII letters, digits, or hyphens and start with a letter. `patch_port` is an OVS patch-interface name rather than a Linux netdev: it must be non-empty, start with a lowercase ASCII letter, and contain only lowercase ASCII letters, digits, hyphens, or underscores. NICo does not apply the Linux 15-character limit to patch ports. Both names must be unique across the rendered OVS topology. DPF requires exactly one configured PF and also rejects duplicate identities, generated-name collisions, BF3 raw-representor collisions, configurations spanning more than one selected controller/PF parent, hardware VF counts above 126, and VFs whose `vf_id` is greater than 15 or greater than or equal to `dpu_config.num_of_vfs`. PF selection is independent of that VF count.

Pre-DPF bridging configurations retain their existing provisioning behavior:
`dpf_interface` may be omitted, `skip_create=true` remains valid, `hbn_bridge` still defaults to
`br-hbn`, and the sorted provisioning value remains exactly
`<representor>:<bridge>:<patch_port>`. DPF ignores `hbn_reps`, derives
`br-sfc` internally, and uses the typed identity rather than the map key.

For a DPF-managed host with a configured intercept inventory, the topology is exclusively the complete VMaaS-managed PF/VF inventory. NICo retains the fixed `p0` and `p1` physical interfaces and assigns both to HBN. Every configured PF or VF becomes a Patch interface between `br-sfc` and its configured intermediate bridge and is assigned to HBN and DHCP; only the selected PF is also assigned to FMDS. The selected hardware PF is exposed inside HBN as `pf0hpf_if`, and VF identity `vf_id` as `pf0vf{vf_id}_if`, regardless of the configured controller and PF identifiers. DHCP exposes them as `d_pf0hpf_if` and `d_pf0vf{vf_id}_if`; FMDS exposes the selected PF as `f_pf0hpf_if`. For `P` configured PFs and `V` configured VFs, NICo manages `2 + P + V` HBN endpoints, `P + V` DHCP endpoints, and `P` FMDS endpoints, for `2 + 3P + 2V` total SF-backed service endpoints. The one-selected-PF contract requires `P = 1`; together with the VF15 bound, it permits at most 19 generated HBN interfaces. The generated HBN inventory may not exceed 32 interfaces. With `allow_instance_vf=true`, instance creation and network updates admit only the explicitly configured VF IDs; a PF-only topology therefore admits no instance VFs.

BF4 Astra is the exception to topology-backed DPF admission. Its DPF deployment always provisions the static VF0 through VF13 interface inventory, so instance creation and network updates use that same inventory even when the site has a configured intercept topology.

For a DPF-managed host with no configured intercept topology, NICo deliberately preserves the established static VF0–VF13 inventory, its VF0–VF7 DHCP subset, and historical instance admission behavior. In this mode, `pf_total_sf_reserved` is the complete `PF_TOTAL_SF`; it defaults to `30`, and explicit operator overrides remain supported. Reconciling these DPF inventory and DHCP surfaces would change existing ServiceInterfaces and the hashed DPUFlavor, so it is deferred to a separately planned cleanup and DPU re-ingestion migration.

For a non-DPF host, instance admission follows HBN's representor selection even when DPF is enabled for the site. Explicit `hbn_reps` entries select PF0 VFs by individual ID or inclusive range, and `dpu_config.num_of_vfs` caps that selection to the configured hardware population. Omitted or empty `hbn_reps` values use HBN's VF0–VF13 fallback.

### `DpfInterfaceIdentity`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `controller_id` | `u8` | **required** | DPF controller number (`0..=255`) containing the selected PF or VF. |
| `pf_id` | `u8` | **required** | PF identifier (`0..=255`) on the selected controller. |
| `vf_id` | `Option<u8>` | — | VF identifier. Omission selects the PF. Under DPF intercept topology, presence selects that VMaaS VF and requires both `vf_id <= 15` and `vf_id < dpu_config.num_of_vfs`; pre-DPF provisioning ignores this typed field. |

### `DpuConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `bootstrap_ca_source` | `BootstrapCaSource` | `legacy_download` | How non-DPF DPUs obtain the API trust anchor: `legacy_download`, `embedded`, or `mounted`. Omitting the field preserves the historical PXE download. The field is not sent to host Scout boots. Non-network modes do not fall back to downloading. |
| `dpu_nic_firmware_initial_update_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable DPU NIC firmware updates on initial discovery. |
| `dpu_nic_firmware_reprovision_update_enabled` | `bool` | `true` | Enable DPU NIC firmware updates on reprovisioning. |
| `dpu_models` | `HashMap<String, Firmware>` | *(BF2+BF3 defaults)* | DPU model firmware definitions. |
| `dpu_nic_firmware_update_versions` | `Vec<String>` | *(BF2+BF3 NIC versions)* | DPU NIC firmware version strings. |
| `dpu_enable_secure_boot` | `bool` | `false` | Enable secure boot flow for DPU provisioning via Redfish. |
| `num_of_vfs` | `u32` | `16` | Number of hardware VFs configured per DPU PF during BlueField provisioning. Max `126`. Under DPF, changing this value changes the immutable BF3/generic-BF4 flavor and requires a carbide-api restart and DPU reprovisioning. Reducing it below the static inventory's previous effective VF count also removes desired VF ServiceInterfaces; because NICo does not prune them, operators must stop NICo, remove the omitted NICo ServiceInterfaces, re-ingest the DPUs, and restart. Configured intercept inventories remain valid only while every selected `vf_id` is both lower than this value and no greater than 15. |
| `service_vpc_slot_count` | `u32` | `0` | Number of HBN interfaces reserved for externally coordinated service-VPC attachments on BF3 and generic BF4. Must be zero when `tenant_prefix_overlap_enabled = true`; otherwise startup fails. NICo generates stable names from `iface_svc_0` through `iface_svc_{N-1}`. The generated interfaces count toward HBN's 32-interface limit and increase its `nvidia.com/bf_sf` request. BF4 Astra ignores this field when generating interfaces, but the startup restriction still applies. |
| `additional_managed_sf` | `u32` | `0` | Additional BF3/generic-BF4 SF capacity without a generated HBN interface. This value and `service_vpc_slot_count` are added to the managed SF count used to size or validate `PF_TOTAL_SF`. BF4 Astra ignores this field. |
| `restart_ovs_on_use_admin_network_change` | `bool` | `false` | Restart OVS on DPU-OS agents when host `use_admin_network` changes. Containerized agents skip the local service restart and still ACK the network config. |

With intercept bridging, both SF settings increase `PF_TOTAL_SF`, change the
`DPUFlavor`, and require controlled DPU reprovisioning. Without intercept
bridging, they consume the unchanged legacy `pf_total_sf_reserved` pool, and
startup rejects an overcommit. NICo does not create bridges, ServiceInterfaces,
service chains, IPAM, or application-service CRs for service-VPC slots; an
external controller must coordinate them. Changes are read at API startup.

To use `embedded`, build a site-specific BFB with an explicit
`BOOTSTRAP_CA_PATH`. The build provides no repository or default CA fallback
for the dedicated embedded payload. Existing legacy artifact inputs remain
unchanged. It stages the source at `/opt/forge/embedded_forge_root.pem`.

This path is separate from `/opt/forge/forge_root.pem`, which the provisioning
environment must populate for `mounted`. NICo does not create that mount. Both
modes fail closed when their own bundle is absent or invalid. Changing this
setting affects the next DPU network boot or reprovisioning. It does not affect
host Scout boots or rewrite installed DPUs in place. The selected CA validates
the NICo API server certificate. This validation remains necessary even when
client-certificate authentication is not used.

### `NetworkSecurityGroupConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `max_network_security_group_size` | `u32` | `200` | Max expanded rules per NSG. |
| `stateful_acls_enabled` | `bool` | `true` | Allow stateful NSG creation and stateless-to-stateful updates, and enable supporting NVUE configuration on DPUs. When disabled, existing stateful NSGs remain editable but behave statelessly. |
| `policy_overrides` | `Vec<NetworkSecurityGroupRule>` | `[]` | NSG rules injected before user-defined rules. |

### `FnnConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `admin_vpc` | `Option<AdminFnnConfig>` | — | FNN configuration for the admin network VPC. |
| `common_internal_route_target` | `Option<RouteTargetConfig>` | — | Double-tag for internal tenant routes (consumed by the network infrastructure). |
| `additional_route_target_imports` | `Vec<RouteTargetConfig>` | `[]` | Extra route targets imported on DPU VRFs. |
| `routing_profiles` | `HashMap<String, FnnRoutingProfileConfig>` | `{}` | Named per-VPC routing profiles (see [FnnRoutingProfileConfig](#fnnroutingprofileconfig)). |
| `use_vpc_vrf_loopback` | `bool` | `false` | Whether IPs are allocated for VPC loopbacks. When false, the VPC loopback pool is unused and no VPC/VRF loopback IP is sent to the DPU. |

### `FnnRoutingProfileConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `route_target_imports` | `Option<Vec<RouteTargetConfig>>` | — (effective `[]`) | Route targets imported into DPU VRFs for VPC routes. |
| `route_targets_on_exports` | `Option<Vec<RouteTargetConfig>>` | — (effective `[]`) | Route targets added to routes exported by the DPU. |
| `internal` | `Option<bool>` | — (effective `false`) | Whether the profile uses internal VNI allocation. This property cannot be overridden on a VPC. |
| `tenant_prefix_overlap_eligible` | `bool` | `false` | Base routing profile opt-in for [tenant prefix overlap checks](#tenant-prefix-overlap-checks). This setting cannot be overridden on a VPC. |
| `leak_default_route_from_underlay` | `Option<bool>` | — (effective `false`) | Leak the default route from the underlay/default VRF into tenant VRFs. Do not enable this for an address family whose effective `site_fabric_null_routes` contains `/0`; the imported default has a better administrative distance than the equal-prefix blackhole. |
| `leak_tenant_host_routes_to_underlay` | `Option<bool>` | — (effective `false`) | Leak tenant host routes into the underlay/default VRF. |
| `tenant_leak_communities_accepted` | `Option<bool>` | — (effective `false`) | Honor route-leak communities sent by the tenant host OS. |
| `accepted_leaks_from_underlay` | `Option<Vec<PrefixFilterPolicyEntry>>` | — (effective `[]`) | Specific underlay/default VRF prefixes allowed to leak into tenant VRFs. Routing only; does not affect ACLs. |
| `allowed_anycast_prefixes` | `Option<Vec<PrefixFilterPolicyEntry>>` | — (effective `[]`) | IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes that tenant hosts are allowed to announce to the DPU as anycast routes. |
| `access_tier` | `Option<u32>` | — (effective `0`) | Routing profile access tier. Lower values grant broader access. This property cannot be overridden on a VPC. |

Unset properties retain presence information so a VPC's inline
`routing_profile_overrides` can inherit them. After the named profile and VPC
override are combined, properties still unset use the effective defaults above.

### SitePrefix isolation rules

Core includes current configured `site_fabric_prefixes` and retained tenant-managed
SitePrefixes in the legacy DPU `site_fabric_prefixes` input. Duplicate, contained,
and adjacent prefixes are combined only when the resulting list covers exactly
the same addresses. This legacy list is sorted by address family, address, and
prefix length. Logical SitePrefix records and their ownership are unchanged.

An empty configured `site_fabric_prefixes` list contributes no operator roots;
it does not remove retained tenant-managed SitePrefixes from the legacy list.
A site with neither configured nor tenant roots sends an empty legacy list.
Including a root in this field alone does not prove isolation on an older agent.

FNN uses the separate `site_fabric_null_routes` response field. When the setting
is omitted, Core includes configured roots, every retained tenant root, and
retiring operator roots while their VpcPrefixes or VPC-attached direct
NetworkPrefixes remain. Soft deletion does not end operator-root retention.
These routes are reduced to their minimal exact union and sorted by CIDR string.
The anonymous `Version` RPC keeps its existing operator-route output: configured
and retained operator roots, without tenant-managed SitePrefixes. Its
`RuntimeConfig.site_fabric_null_routes` field is not a complete audit of DPU
isolation routes. Use `GetManagedHostNetworkConfig` to inspect the tenant-inclusive
FNN response; built-in RBAC restricts that RPC when `bypass_rbac` is false.

An explicit `site_fabric_null_routes` list is not augmented with either kind of
retained root. Its distinct boundaries are preserved, including nested and
adjacent entries. Under mutual isolation, new tenant roots must be covered by one equal or broader
explicit route; several narrower routes do not qualify. Uncovered creation
returns `FailedPrecondition` without persisting the root or its history.
Startup applies the same coverage check to every retained tenant root, including
unused roots and roots in `Deleting`, even when `tenant_prefix_overlap_enabled`
is false and no VpcPrefixes overlap.
An explicit empty list therefore blocks new tenant roots and prevents startup
while any tenant roots remain. Every FNN DPU response, including an Admin-only
response, repeats this check against retained roots, so a root admitted by
another Core replica cannot silently lose coverage under a different explicit
override. ETV responses do not apply this FNN coverage check. Version still
reports the explicit override without checking tenant coverage, so operators
can inspect it. Existing create retries still return their root.

With `vpc_isolation_behavior = "open"`, DPUs install no isolation routes. Tenant
creation, startup, and DPU responses therefore do not require explicit-route
coverage in this mode; an explicit empty list remains valid with retained roots.

To recover startup or FNN configuration serving after an override loses coverage,
restore an explicit list that covers every retained tenant root, or omit
`site_fabric_null_routes` to inherit them, then restart the affected Core replicas.
Requesting deletion does not remove a retained root from the check. Recovery
does not require manual database edits.

Older Core versions can create tenant roots without checking an explicit
null-route override. If old and new API processes overlap during an upgrade,
an old process can create an uncovered root after the new process passes its
startup check. New FNN responses then fail the coverage check.

For mutual-isolation sites using an explicit override, prevent that sequence
with the existing tenant quota:

1. Set `max_site_prefixes_per_tenant = 0` on every API process and finish restarting
   or draining the processes and requests using the previous setting. This
   blocks new tenant roots while preserving unchanged creation retries.
2. Check that every explicit override covers all retained tenant roots, or omit
   `site_fabric_null_routes` to inherit them.
3. Upgrade every API process before restoring the tenant quota. If returning to
   an older version, keep creation blocked while versions overlap.

This creation freeze is unnecessary when the old API and its requests are fully
stopped before the new API starts, or when null routes are inherited. Setting
`tenant_prefix_overlap_enabled = false` does not block SitePrefix creation.
This procedure addresses explicit-override coverage, not readiness. Upgrading
from an API that does not render tenant prefixes also requires the drain
described below, even when null routes are inherited.

`max_site_prefix_isolation_rules` limits the compacted legacy list when creating a
tenant-managed root. It defaults to `64` and accepts integers from `0` through
`64`; configuration loading rejects other values. Changes require restarting
Core. Under mutual isolation, zero blocks new roots. Open isolation does not
enforce this limit. The initial ceiling is an operational restriction,
not an FNN null-route count or a hardware-capacity guarantee. Retiring operator
roots and explicit null-route overrides are excluded from the count. Raising
the ceiling requires the qualification tracked
by [#3902](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/3902).
The separate `max_site_prefixes_per_tenant` quota still counts logical tenant roots.

If existing use exceeds a lowered limit, new roots are rejected even when adding
one would compact the list below that limit. Existing roots continue to render,
and a retry using an existing ID and unchanged immutable fields still returns
that root. Core reports `ResourceExhausted` with the current, proposed, and maximum
legacy input counts for rejected creation. Exceeding the limit does not itself
block startup or truncate either DPU input. New tenant roots intersecting a configured
`deny_prefixes` entry are rejected with `InvalidArgument`.

Tenant roots remain included in every retained lifecycle state, including
`Deleting`, even when `tenant_prefix_overlap_enabled` is false. New tenant roots start
in `Provisioning` and cannot be used for new VpcPrefixes until they become `Ready`.
Under `mutual_isolation`, `nico-api` requests a network configuration update for
hosts assigned to Instances or still able to serve tenant traffic. The readiness
controller waits for every DPU in each affected host's topology to acknowledge
the current host network configuration version before marking the root `Ready`.
Missing acknowledgements leave the root `Provisioning`. Retries and API restarts
resume that wait without repeatedly changing the target versions.

If a host's network configuration changes during creation, `CreateSitePrefix`
can return `FailedPrecondition` with a message asking the caller to retry. The
transaction rolls back the new root and every version update; retry the request.

An unavailable DPU on any affected host can keep new tenant prefixes waiting.
The controller logs `Waiting for SitePrefix DPU acknowledgements` with the
`site_prefix_id`, the first blocking `host_machine_id`, its
`network_config_version`, and `isolation_requested_at`. The latest handler result
is also stored in `site_prefixes.controller_state_outcome`; it is not exposed
through the SitePrefix RPCs or CLI. Restore the missing DPU acknowledgement
instead of changing the prefix to `Ready` manually. An unrelated host network
update can extend the wait because readiness checks the current version.

Ordinary waits check acknowledgements without the routing lock. Before marking
a prefix `Ready`, the controller takes the shared routing lock and checks again.
The initial request still scans affected hosts and updates their versions while
holding the exclusive routing lock, which blocks DPU configuration requests.
The duration of that work needs qualification at the site's fleet size.

Idle hosts do not delay readiness. A later Instance assignment receives the retained
tenant prefixes with its network configuration. With `open`, the controller marks
the root `Ready` without refreshing host versions or waiting for isolation
acknowledgements. `vpc_isolation_behavior` is selected at installation; changing
an existing site from `open` to `mutual_isolation` is not supported and does not
restart readiness for prefixes already marked `Ready`.

Retiring operator roots are excluded from the legacy input but remain in inherited
FNN null routes until their children are hard-deleted.

Before starting an API with this readiness controller, every API process serving
DPU configurations must include the tenant-prefix rendering added in
[#6388](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/pull/6388).
For a direct upgrade from an API without it, such as `v2.2.0-rc.8`, stop the old
API processes and drain their requests before starting the new API. The Helm
and Kustomize `RollingUpdate` deployments do not enforce this ordering, even
with one replica. Otherwise, an old API can return a new network version
without its tenant-prefix protection, and its DPU acknowledgement can incorrectly
satisfy readiness. Setting the tenant quota to zero does not prevent recovery of
existing `Provisioning` roots and is not sufficient for this upgrade.

An API such as `v2.2.0-rc.8` can have cached wildcard queries on `site_prefixes`.
Adding `isolation_requested_at` and `controller_state_outcome` can make those
queries fail until the old API's connections or process are replaced. Stopping
the old API before migrations avoids this additional error window.

Deleting a tenant root still keeps its CIDR, quota slot, and protection until final
removal. The retirement work in
[#3894](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/3894) requires proof
that learned routes have been withdrawn; a configuration acknowledgement alone
does not provide that proof.

### Tenant prefix overlap checks

`tenant_prefix_overlap_enabled` defaults to `false`. When set to `true`, NICo
checks whether two `VpcPrefix` records may reuse the same CIDR. It does not
permit direct `NetworkPrefix` reuse or change the database constraints.

An overlapping `VpcPrefix` pair is eligible only when all of these conditions
are true:

- The requested and existing CIDRs are identical, the existing `VpcPrefix` is
  not deleted, and the `VpcPrefix` records belong to different VPCs. The VPCs
  may belong to the same tenant and share one tenant-managed `SitePrefix`.
- Both VPCs use FNN and have distinct `status.vni` values. Each VPC owns exactly
  one VNI allocation across the internal and external pools, matching
  `status.vni`. A retained previous allocation makes the VPC ineligible.
- Each `VpcPrefix` is linked to a tenant-managed, `DatacenterOnly` `SitePrefix`
  owned by its VPC tenant and containing the `VpcPrefix` CIDR. The requested
  `SitePrefix` must be `Ready`; the existing `SitePrefix` may be `Ready` or
  `Deleting`.
- Site-wide `vpc_isolation_behavior` is `"mutual_isolation"`.
- `site_global_vpc_vni` and `common_internal_route_target` are unset, and
  `additional_route_target_imports` is empty, so they cannot bridge the VPCs.
- The deprecated site-wide `anycast_site_prefixes` list is empty.
- `dpu_config.service_vpc_slot_count` is zero. Service-VPC attachments have not
  been qualified for overlapping prefixes; enabling overlap with reserved
  service-VPC slots fails startup.
- Each resolved FNN profile, after applying its VPC overrides, has
  `tenant_prefix_overlap_eligible = true` and `internal = true`; has no import
  or export route targets; disables default-route leakage, tenant-host-route
  leakage, and tenant leak communities; and has no accepted underlay leaks or
  allowed anycast prefixes.

The FNN renderer falls back to `anycast_site_prefixes` for IPv4 when the profile
has no IPv4 `allowed_anycast_prefixes`. The IPv6 list has no such fallback.
The [chart's default configuration](../../../../helm/charts/nico-api/files/carbide-api-config.toml)
sets `anycast_site_prefixes = ["0.0.0.0/0"]`; a site using that default must
override it with `[]` to meet the overlap requirements.

For an overlapping prefix, `CreateVpcPrefix` locks the participating VPCs
until its transaction ends. Concurrent VNI changes or VPC deletion must wait,
including for a VPC owned by another tenant.

The gRPC `CreateNetworkSegment` handler, when a VPC is specified, and
`AttachNetworkSegmentToVpc` reject any direct prefix that overlaps a `VpcPrefix`,
regardless of the site gate. The gRPC `CreateVpcPrefix` handler considers prefixes
on attached segments. It can
adopt only direct Tenant segment prefixes in the same VPC that are not already
linked to a `VpcPrefix`; every other direct `NetworkPrefix` overlap on an
attached segment is rejected. An unattached `CreateNetworkSegment` request can
overlap a globally scoped `VpcPrefix`, but rejects overlap with a VPC-scoped
`VpcPrefix` regardless of the site gate. A later VPC attachment rejects either
overlap. Every `CreateNetworkSegment` request takes the overlap transaction lock
until its transaction ends, including requests without a VPC.

Networks seeded from the site configuration retain their existing allowance to
overlap a globally scoped `VpcPrefix`, even when `vpc_name` attaches them to a VPC.
They still reject overlaps with VPC-scoped prefixes.

With `tenant_prefix_overlap_enabled = true`, peering creation, `VpcPrefix`
creation, and VPC virtualization changes that add imports also check each
affected receiver's local and imported prefixes. Core returns `InvalidArgument`
if a change would make one VPC receive overlapping address space from different
VPCs. Direct peer imports follow the renderer, including its independent VNI
imports; there are no transitive peer imports. Prefixes awaiting removal still
count. These writers also check the combined networks of each affected Instance,
including Instances waiting for their network segments and pending replacements.

VPC routing-profile changes check the affected tenant-serving FNN interfaces. Allocated Instances remain relevant even before their controllers leave Admin networking, including while waiting for network segments. Pending networks and deleting Instances not yet in the controller's return-to-Admin state also count. Core rejects unsafe routing-profile changes on these paths with `FailedPrecondition`, even before duplicate CIDRs exist. A VPC that owns retained overlapping tenant prefixes must also preserve routing isolation, even without Instances. Other unused definitions remain editable. Metadata updates, unchanged stored routing policy, and proven restrictions do not take the overlap transaction lock unless a concurrent update changes the policy they replace. With overlap enabled, `UpdateVpc` can return `FailedPrecondition` if the VPC changes while the request waits for its row lock. With overlap disabled, requests without `if_version_match` instead use the latest locked record and repeat any needed routing-policy checks. Explicit version conditions still apply in either mode.

Instance allocation and network expansion check all VPCs used by the requested, current, and pending networks together, including their direct peer imports. An Instance must not connect to overlapping address space from different VPCs, even when those VPCs are otherwise isolated. Core returns `InvalidArgument` for that conflict. With overlap enabled, allocation and network expansion also check the effective FNN routing policy before duplicate CIDRs exist. Network expansion requires an eligible resolved routing profile and safe site-wide policy. NSG permits and stateful egress do not participate in overlap admission: FNN isolation is enforced by routing blackholes, which ACL policy cannot bypass.

New prefix reuse requires coverage from the explicit `site_fabric_null_routes`
configuration when present. When omitted, the participant tenant-managed
SitePrefixes supply inherited coverage even outside configured operator ranges.
Retained-state validation uses all retained tenant roots and retiring operator
roots, matching the routes sent to FNN. Retiring operator roots do not authorize
new reuse. An explicit empty list disables tenant prefix reuse.

When `tenant_prefix_overlap_enabled = false` but another VPC still uses the same addresses, Instance allocation and network expansion return `InvalidArgument`. Prefixes being deleted still count. Metadata edits and removal of unchanged interfaces remain available. A request cannot replace a pending network update. Requests that need admission take the overlap transaction lock before resource locks, including when the gate is off. A waiting Instance update reloads its dependencies but keeps its original configuration version. If that version changed, the request returns `FailedPrecondition`.

With the gate off, peering and VPC virtualization changes also reject new imports of overlapping address space involving a tenant-managed `VpcPrefix`. Existing imports and nonexpanding changes remain available. Unsafe routing-profile changes are rejected where the VPC owns retained overlapping tenant prefixes or an affected Instance can reach that duplicate address space.

Core checks retained prefixes, peer imports, Instance networks, and effective
FNN policy before starting controllers or the API listener, including with
`listen_only = true`. Startup network seeding and Admin VPC attachment check
their changes before committing. An unsafe retained configuration fails startup.
Tenant DPU configuration requests also check their retained networks before
returning tenant interfaces. Admin-only responses skip the per-Instance network
checks; under mutual isolation, every FNN response still checks explicit
null-route coverage for all retained tenant roots.
With overlap enabled, the policy checks apply to every retained FNN network on
a DPU Instance, even before duplicate prefixes exist.
These checks coordinate with admission writers through the same transaction
lock. DPU configuration requests share the read lock with each other.
A routing writer holding the exclusive lock blocks configuration requests
across the site until its transaction ends.

With overlap disabled, the retained VPC routing checks apply only to
overlaps involving a tenant-managed `VpcPrefix`. Overlaps between existing
operator-managed or rootless prefixes do not activate them. This preserves
existing configurations, including Admin networks, without weakening the
checks on tenant-managed prefixes retained after disabling overlap. Explicit
null-route coverage for retained tenant roots is required under mutual
isolation, even without duplicate VPC prefixes.

Turning off the site or profile admission opt-in does not invalidate safely
isolated existing networks. Prefixes and their tenant-managed SitePrefixes may
be deleting while routes drain, but routing isolation, VNI ownership, and
effective policy must remain safe. See
[#5116](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/5116) for the
startup and writer checks, following the
[peering and policy checks](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/5114)
and [Instance admission](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/5115).

### Stored Prefix Scope

`network_vpc_prefixes.overlap_vpc_id` and `network_prefixes.overlap_vpc_id` are
internal database fields, not API or configuration settings. `NULL` means the
row remains globally exclusive. Core sets a VPC ID only for a new IPv4
`VpcPrefix` using an eligible tenant-managed SitePrefix and routing profile,
with the site overlap gate enabled and the site-wide isolation policy described
above. An explicit `site_fabric_null_routes` override must cover the prefix.
Without an override, scope selection does not require containment in configured
operator ranges. Scope does not authorize overlap: pair admission still checks
effective route coverage and all other overlap requirements described above.
Generated, non-stretched Tenant linknets inherit that ID from their exact
parent. Direct segments remain global even when a VpcPrefix adopts them.

Existing rows and inserts from older binaries remain global. An older binary
can also create a global child beneath a scoped parent. Current routing
eligibility does not change either row's stored scope. Admission rejects a
conflict when either participant is global, including an attached global child.
Allocation and reported capacity use the same scope comparison: only a child
in a different non-null VPC scope can be ignored.

The four partial database exclusions protect global rows from each other and
scoped rows within the same VPC, including rows awaiting deletion. They do not
compare global rows with scoped rows or compare the two prefix tables. Writers
take the same overlap transaction lock and check those conflicts before
inserting. Generated Tenant linknets record their exact parent and scope in the
initial insert; adopting a direct segment does not change its global scope.
VPC-less, unparented networks retain their existing ability to overlap a global
VPC prefix, but cannot later attach to a VPC over that overlap. They cannot
overlap a scoped VPC prefix, even when the site admission flag is disabled.

### Prefix Overlap Database Cutover

The [#3892 cutover](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/3892)
removes the two original global exclusions. It does not change existing scope
values or enable tenant prefix overlap. Before applying this migration:

1. Keep `tenant_prefix_overlap_enabled = false` on every outgoing API version
   that supports this setting. Wait for any previously enabled process and its
   requests to finish.
2. If the two prefix tables already have `overlap_vpc_id`, run this read-only
   preflight. Both counts must be zero, including rows awaiting deletion. If
   either count is nonzero, stop the upgrade and resolve it separately; do not
   clear or backfill scopes to pass the check.

```sql
SELECT 'network_vpc_prefixes' AS table_name, count(*) AS scoped_rows
FROM network_vpc_prefixes WHERE overlap_vpc_id IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'network_prefixes', count(*)
FROM network_prefixes WHERE overlap_vpc_id IS NOT NULL;
```

If the columns do not exist yet, skip that query. The additive scope migration
creates them as nullable columns, so existing rows and writes from the old API
remain global. No intermediate API release is required.

Keep the flag false while deploying the migration and new binary, until every
old process and request has finished. With all scopes null and the flag off,
outgoing writes remain global and the retained global partial exclusions keep
rejecting same-table overlaps. The migration rebuilds full-table GiST indexes
for overlap lookups without their former exclusion semantics. It holds table
locks during that work and may wait for active transactions; new queries can
queue behind it. Concurrent traffic can deadlock with the migration, aborting
either the API request or the migration attempt. A failed migration rolls back
the whole file; the Helm and Kustomize migration Jobs restart failed containers.
An upgrade that also adds the scope columns builds the exclusion indexes under
table locks as well.
Cached wildcard queries on the outgoing API's connections can still fail until
that API is replaced.

After cutover, the following structural check must return eight rows, all with
`convalidated = t`. Scope checks and the foreign key constrain each non-null
scope to its stored VPC and exact parent. Startup also validates runtime routing
policy.

```sql
SELECT conname, convalidated
FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid IN ('public.network_vpc_prefixes'::regclass, 'public.network_prefixes'::regclass)
  AND (conname LIKE '%overlap%' OR contype = 'x')
ORDER BY conname;
```

This database change is not site enablement approval. DPU isolation and the
[qualification work](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/3902)
remain prerequisites. Disabling overlap does not remove duplicate data or make
an older binary safe to restore. The final operator rollout and rollback
procedure is tracked in [#3903](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/3903).

### `VpcDefinition`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `organization_id` | `Option<String>` | — | Tenant organization that owns the seeded VPC. |
| `network_virtualization_type` | `VpcVirtualizationType` | **required** | Data plane used by the VPC. |
| `routing_profile_type` | `Option<String>` | — | Named FNN routing profile recorded on the seeded VPC. |
| `routing_profile_overrides` | `Option<VpcRoutingProfileOverrides>` | — | Unsupported for seeded VPCs. Any configured value causes startup to fail; inline overrides are accepted only by VPC creation or update requests. |
| `vni` | `Option<i32>` | — | Desired VNI; when absent, one is allocated. |

### `PrefixFilterPolicyEntry`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `prefix` | `IpNetwork` | **required** | IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR prefix accepted by a prefix-list policy. |

### `EwEthersConfig`

Legacy site files may still name this section `[dpa_config]` (accepted as an
alias) and may inline `mqtt_endpoint`, `mqtt_broker_port`, `hb_interval`, and
`auth`; those keys are migrated into `svpc` at load time with a deprecation
warning. Nest them under `[ewethers_config.svpc]` in new configurations.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable Cluster Interconnect Network. |
| `svpc_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable the SVPC path. Not mutually exclusive with `astra_enabled`. |
| `astra_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable the Astra path. Not mutually exclusive with `svpc_enabled`. |
| `subnet_ip` | `Ipv4Addr` | `0.0.0.0` | Base IPv4 address of the DPA subnet. |
| `subnet_mask` | `i32` | `0` | CIDR prefix length for the DPA subnet. |
| `monitor_run_interval` | `Duration` | `60s` | The interval at which the DPA monitor runs. |
| `svpc` | `SvpcConfig` | *(defaults)* | SVPC MQTT connection settings (see [SvpcConfig](#svpcconfig)). |

### `SvpcConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `mqtt_endpoint` | `String` | `"mqtt.forge"` | MQTT broker host for the SVPC path. |
| `mqtt_broker_port` | `u16` | `1884` | MQTT broker port. |
| `hb_interval` | `Duration` | `2m` | Heartbeat interval for DPA health checks. |
| `auth` | `MqttAuthConfig` | *(none)* | MQTT authentication settings. |

### `DsxExchangeEventBusConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable the DSX Exchange Event Bus for managed-host state publishing, BMS metadata subscription, and BMS rack/isolation/heartbeat publishing. |
| `mqtt_endpoint` | `String` | `"mqtt.nico"` | MQTT broker host. |
| `mqtt_broker_port` | `u16` | `1884` | MQTT broker port. |
| `publish_timeout` | `Duration` | `1s` | Timeout for MQTT publish operations. |
| `queue_capacity` | `usize` | `1024` | Event buffer size for DSX publish work (events dropped when full). |
| `auth` | `MqttAuthConfig` | *(none)* | MQTT authentication settings. |
| `topic_prefix` | `String` | `NICO/v1/machine` | Topic prefix used when publishing `ManagedHostState` transitions; the full topic is `{topic_prefix}/{machineId}/state`. NATS subjects are case-sensitive, so this must match the producer pub allow configured on the broker. |
| `periodic_state_republish` | `PeriodicStateRepublishConfig` | *(enabled)* | Periodically re-publish current managed-host state so consumers that miss change events can reconcile (see [PeriodicStateRepublishConfig](#periodicstaterepublishconfig)). |

### `PeriodicStateRepublishConfig`

In addition to publishing on every state change, NICo can re-publish current
`ManagedHostState` on a timer. Republished messages use the same
`{topic_prefix}/{machineId}/state` topic and JSON payload as change-driven
events, so consumers handle them identically.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `true` | Enable periodic republishing (on by default whenever the DSX Exchange Event Bus is enabled). Change-driven publishing is unaffected by this setting. |
| `interval` | `Duration` | `5m` | How often a republish sweep runs, clamped to 1 second through 1 hour. |
| `scope` | `RepublishScope` | `all` | Which managed hosts to publish each sweep (see [RepublishScope](#republishscope)). |
| `healthy_republish_every` | `u32` | `1` | When `scope = all`, publish healthy hosts only every Nth sweep; hosts with an active health alert are always published every sweep. `0` is treated as `1`. Ignored when `scope = unhealthy_only`. |
| `max_publishes_per_second` | `u32` | `0` | Upper bound on publishes per second within a sweep, to avoid bursting the broker on large sites. `0` disables pacing. |

### `RepublishScope`

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `all` | Republish every managed host each sweep (healthy hosts may be published less often via `healthy_republish_every`). |
| `unhealthy_only` | Republish only managed hosts that currently have a health alert. |

### `DpfConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable DPF Kubernetes deployment. |
| `deployment_scoped_service_interfaces` | `bool` | `false` | Migration knob for deployment-scoped DPUServiceInterfaces. BF3 sites (including BF3 GB200) and BF4-generic-only sites use unscoped interfaces by default for backward compatibility. BF4 Astra requires this setting so the whole DPF namespace uses scoped ServiceInterfaces and legacy unscoped ServiceInterfaces cannot also bind Astra nodes. When enabled, NICo removes legacy unscoped ServiceInterfaces before creating scoped replacements. If cleanup remains incomplete for ten minutes, NICo logs an error and continues waiting. If an operator manually completes unscoped cleanup, NICo creates scoped replacements. The setting is read only at startup. To return to unscoped interfaces, stop NICo, delete the scoped ServiceInterfaces and wait for their deletion, then restart NICo with this set to `false`. If scoped ServiceInterfaces exist, DPF initialization rejects a `false` value. |
| `pf_total_sf_reserved` | `u32` | `30` | SF capacity reserved beyond the NICo-managed HBN, DHCP, and FMDS endpoints when an intercept-bridging inventory is configured. NICo sets `PF_TOTAL_SF` to the effective inventory's endpoint count plus this value for BF3 and generic BF4. Without configured intercept bridging, this value is the complete `PF_TOTAL_SF`, preserving the legacy default of `30`; BF4 Astra retains its fixed flavor and ignores this setting. Changing this value changes the BF3/generic-BF4 flavor. Every intercept-inventory change requires controlled ServiceInterface cleanup and DPU re-ingestion, even when the serialized flavor and its hash remain unchanged. Operators must select a value compatible with their platform's SF and BAR capacity. With configured intercept bridging, startup rejects configurations whose managed endpoint count plus reserve exceeds `u32::MAX`. |
| `dpu_service_sync_enabled` | `bool` | `true` | Whether NICo rolls a changed DPUService out on its own, by releasing the DPF maintenance hold on hosts whose DPUs already match their DPUDeployment. Selects *who* opens the gate, never whether one exists: DPF is always configured to park a changed DPUService behind a hold, so no service update reaches a DPU unchecked. Setting `false` does not resume unchecked rollout — the held DPUs wait for an operator to release them deliberately. Hosts still awaiting reprovisioning, and hosts carrying a live tenant instance, keep their hold either way. |
| `dpu_agent_bootstrap_ca` | `DpfDpuAgentBootstrapCa` | `legacy_download` | Bootstrap trust for the containerized DPU agent. Supports `legacy_download` and `mounted`, as described in the following examples. |
| `services` | `Box<DpfMandatoryServicesConfig>` | built-in mandatory-service defaults | Helm chart, image, pull-secret, and `extra_helm_values` settings for the six mandatory DPF services. |
| `extra_services` | `Box<DpfExtraServicesConfig>` | built-in extra-service defaults | Site-wide Helm chart, image, pull-secret, and `extra_helm_values` settings for deployment-specific services. BF4 Astra uses Weave DHCP agent, Weave flow controller, and Xplane; BF3 and generic BF4 do not render them. |
| `docker_image_pull_secret` | `Option<String>` | — | Override for the Kubernetes `imagePullSecrets` entry used to pull mandatory-service images (applied to every mandatory service except `dts` and `doca_hbn`, which take a pull secret only from their per-service config). It is the fallback for an Astra extra service that has no per-service pull secret. |
| `proxy` | `Option<DpfProxyDetails>` | — | Proxy configuration for the DPU. When set, containerd on the DPU routes outbound HTTPS traffic through it. |
| `extra_bfcfg_parameters` | `Vec<String>` | `[]` | `bf.cfg` lines appended to each deployment's [DPUFlavor `bfcfgParameters`](https://networking-docs.nvidia.com/dpf/26.4.1/dpuflavor) — for example, a DPU login password (`ubuntu_PASSWORD='$6$...'`). These site-wide lines are appended first, followed by that deployment's own `extra_bfcfg_parameters`. Entries are passed through verbatim; NICo applies no quoting or interpretation. Entries containing `{{` are rejected at startup. Changing this list creates a new DPUFlavor resource and reprovisions the affected deployment's DPUs; the new parameters take effect during DPU re-install. |
| `deployments` | `DpfDeploymentsConfig` | *(default)* | Per-generation DPUDeployment configurations. BF3 is always present with defaults; BF4 variants are opt-in. A deployment can override individual fields of its supported extra services. |

### `DpfDeploymentConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `bfb_url` | `Option<String>` | BF3 bf-bundle URL | BlueField firmware bundle used for BF3 provisioning. Mutually exclusive with `bluefield_software`; BF4 requires `bluefield_software` instead. |
| `bluefield_software` | `Option<BlueFieldSoftwareConfig>` | — | BF4 OS ISO and PSID-to-PLDM firmware source. BF4 requires this field with at least one `pldm_fw_bundle` entry. |
| `flavor_name` | `String` | `carbide-dpu-flavor` | Base name for the generated BF3/generic-BF4 `DPUFlavor` or Astra `DPUFlavorTemplate`. |
| `deployment_name` | `String` | `nico-deployment-v2` | Name of the generated `DPUDeployment`. |
| `node_label_key` | `String` | `carbide.nvidia.com/controlled.node.v2` | Label key used to select DPU nodes for this deployment. |
| `services` | `Option<Box<DpfMandatoryServicesConfig>>` | inherit `[dpf.services]` | Optional complete per-deployment mandatory-service override. Omitted service entries use built-in defaults rather than top-level values. |
| `extra_services` | `BTreeMap<DpfExtraService, DpfServiceConfigOverride>` | `{}` | Deployment-local overlays for supported extra services. |
| `enable_delay_host_init` | `bool` | `false` | When enabled, delay host initialization until the DPU's `DPUServiceCriticalPodsReady` condition is true. |

Every active DPF deployment must use distinct `deployment_name`, `flavor_name`, and `node_label_key` values. A deployment `node_label_key` must not be `feature.node.kubernetes.io/dpu-enabled`, which marks every DPF-managed node, or `carbide.nvidia.com/host-bmc-ip`, whose per-node contextual value is the host BMC address. These checks use the local configuration and do not query or modify cluster resources.

Each entry under `[dpf.services]` accepts a chart-native `extra_helm_values` table. NICo deep-merges it over generated `DPUServiceTemplate` values. Nested scalars and arrays replace generated values. DPF applies NICo's deployment-specific `DPUServiceConfiguration` values after the template values. Top-level and per-deployment service fields both overlay the service's built-in defaults.

The topology-derived `[dpf.services.doca_hbn.extra_helm_values.resources]` value `nvidia.com/bf_sf` is reserved: NICo restores the effective HBN interface count after applying operator overrides so the SF request, interface assignment, and startup configuration cannot diverge.

```toml
[dpf.services.dpu_agent.extra_helm_values.fmds]
sign_proxy_url = "http://dsx-imds.dpf-operator-system.svc.cluster.local:8080"
```

Omitting `[dpf.dpu_agent_bootstrap_ca]` preserves the historical download URL.
Use the following configuration to retain download mode while overriding the
complete endpoint URL:

```toml
[dpf.dpu_agent_bootstrap_ca]
source = "legacy_download"
# Optional full endpoint URL. Omit to use the agent default.
url = "http://carbide-pxe.forge/api/v0/tls/root_ca"
```

Use the following configuration to project an existing Secret into the DPU
agent init container:

```toml
[dpf.dpu_agent_bootstrap_ca]
source = "mounted"
object_kind = "secret"
name = "nico-bootstrap-ca-v1"
key = "ca.crt"
```

Use the following configuration for a ConfigMap that already exists in every
target DPU cluster:

```toml
[dpf.dpu_agent_bootstrap_ca]
source = "mounted"
object_kind = "config_map"
name = "nico-bootstrap-ca-v1"
key = "ca.crt"
```

The URL override changes routing, not the initial trust model. An HTTPS URL is
authenticated only when its server certificate chains to a root already
trusted by the shared dpu-agent image.

Mounted mode never falls back to the legacy download. The shared published
dpu-agent image does not embed a site-specific trust anchor. A mounted
ConfigMap must already exist in the DPU cluster. A suitably labeled Secret can
be propagated there by DPF.

### `RmsConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `api_url` | `Option<String>` | — | RMS API URL for rack-level firmware upgrades and power sequencing. |
| `root_ca_path` | `Option<String>` | — | Path to the root CA certificate for TLS verification. |
| `client_cert` | `Option<String>` | — | Path to the client certificate PEM for mTLS. |
| `client_key` | `Option<String>` | — | Path to the client private key PEM for mTLS. |
| `enforce_tls` | `bool` | `true` | Enforce TLS when connecting to RMS. |
| `scale_up_fabric_manager_api_version` | `ScaleUpFabricManagerApiVersion` | `v2` | **Deprecated.** Accepted and ignored. Accepts `v1` or `v2`; any other value fails config load. ScaleUpFabricManager configuration submits an asynchronous job and polls it to completion. |

### `SpdmConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable SPDM hardware attestation. |
| `nras_config` | `Option<nras::Config>` | — | NRAS configuration for secure boot verification. |

### `MachineIdentityConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Master switch for machine identity APIs (opt-in; set `true` with `current_encryption_key_id` and credentials). |
| `algorithm` | `String` | `"ES256"` | Signing algorithm for per-org keys. |
| `token_ttl_min_sec` | `u32` | `60` | Minimum token TTL in seconds. |
| `token_ttl_max_sec` | `u32` | `86400` | Maximum token TTL in seconds. |
| `token_endpoint_http_proxy` | `Option<String>` | — | HTTP proxy for token endpoint calls (SSRF mitigation). |
| `current_encryption_key_id` | `Option<String>` | — | Key-id for encrypting new tenant identity ciphertext (selects from the `machine_identity.encryption_keys` secrets). |
| `trust_domain_allowlist` | `Vec<String>` | `[]` | Trust domains allowed for tenant JWT `iss` (normalized host). Empty allows any. Patterns: exact hostname, `*.suffix` (one label under suffix), `**.suffix` (suffix or any subdomain). |
| `token_endpoint_domain_allowlist` | `Vec<String>` | `[]` | Allowed DNS names for the `token_endpoint` URL host (`http://` / `https://` only). Empty allows any; same pattern syntax as `trust_domain_allowlist`. |
| `signing_key_overlap_max_sec` | `u32` | `604800` | Upper bound for `signing_key_overlap_sec` on `SetTenantIdentityConfiguration` when `rotate_key` is true (seconds). |

### `MeasuredBootMetricsCollectorConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable measured boot metrics export. |
| `run_interval` | `Duration` | `60s` | Polling interval for boot measurement data. |

### `MachineValidationConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable machine validation tests. |
| `test_selection_mode` | `MachineValidationTestSelectionMode` | `Default` | `Default`, `EnableAll`, or `DisableAll`. |
| `run_interval` | `Duration` | `60s` | Validation check interval. |
| `stale_run_timeout` | `Duration` | `24h` | Grace period before an active validation run is considered stale. Values below `90s` are raised to `90s` to avoid marking healthy heartbeat-based runs stale. |
| `tests` | `Vec<MachineValidationTestConfig>` | `[]` | Per-test enable/disable overrides. |
| `approved_plugin_registries` | `Vec<String>` | `[]` | Registries allowed for Machine Validation plugin images. Empty denies plugin registration; legacy tests are unaffected. |
| `allowed_plugin_types` | `Vec<String>` | `["container"]` | Plugin execution types allowed for the site. Empty denies plugin registration; the only accepted value is `container`. |
| `allow_privileged_plugins` | `bool` | `false` | Allows registration of plugins that request the privileged container profile. |
| `allow_full_host_plugins` | `bool` | `false` | Allows registration of privileged plugins that request a writable host-root mount. Each revision still needs separate approval before it can be enabled. |
| `attempt_logs` | `MachineValidationAttemptLogConfig` | enabled, 16 KiB/chunk, 1 MiB/attempt, 30d | Site-wide storage policy for Machine Validation attempt logs. |

### `MachineValidationAttemptLogConfig`

TOML section: `[machine_validation_config.attempt_logs]`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `true` | Persists plugin stdout/stderr chunks. When false, appended chunks are discarded. |
| `max_chunk_bytes` | `usize` | `16384` | Maximum stored UTF-8 bytes per chunk; must be greater than zero and no more than `16384` when enabled. |
| `max_attempt_bytes` | `usize` | `1048576` | Maximum total stored UTF-8 bytes per attempt; must be at least `max_chunk_bytes` and no more than `1048576` when enabled. |
| `retention` | `Duration` | `30d` | Non-negative retention duration for terminal-attempt logs. Cleanup runs in bounded batches even when Machine Validation is disabled. |

### `BomValidationConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable BOM/SKU validation. |
| `ignore_unassigned_machines` | `bool` | `false` | Let machines without a SKU bypass validation. |
| `allow_allocation_on_validation_failure` | `bool` | `false` | Keep machines with assigned SKUs allocatable on validation failure; does not bypass unassigned machines. |
| `find_match_interval` | `Duration` | `5m` | Interval between SKU match attempts. |
| `auto_generate_missing_sku` | `bool` | `false` | Auto-create missing SKUs from expected machines. |
| `auto_generate_missing_sku_interval` | `Duration` | `5m` | Interval between auto-generate attempts. |

### `MqttAuthConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `auth_mode` | `MqttAuthMode` | `None` | `none`, `basic_auth`, or `oauth2`. |
| `oauth2` | `Option<MqttOAuth2Config>` | — | OAuth2 settings (required when `auth_mode` is `oauth2`). |

### `MqttOAuth2Config`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `token_url` | `String` | **required** | OAuth2 token endpoint URL. |
| `scopes` | `Vec<String>` | `[]` | OAuth2 scopes to request. |
| `http_timeout` | `Duration` | `30s` | Token endpoint HTTP timeout. |
| `username` | `String` | `"oauth2token"` | Username in MQTT CONNECT packet. |

### `TracingConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to enable OTLP tracing. |
| `allow_runtime_changes` | `bool` | `true` | Whether tracing may be enabled/disabled at runtime (`nico-admin-cli set tracing-enabled`). |
| `otlp_endpoint` | `Option<String>` | — | The endpoint traces are sent to. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` env var takes precedence when set. |

### `LogHistoryConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_megabytes` | `usize` | `128` | Maximum amount of recent log history retained in memory, in MiB. Oldest lines are evicted once the budget is exceeded. |
| `page_size` | `usize` | `500` | Number of lines sent in the initial view and in each scrollback page of the live log viewer. |

### `CredentialsConfig`

The optional `[credentials]` section configures non-secret locations from which
NICo reads operator-managed credentials. Most credentials continue to read the
local environment and file sources before the configured persistent backends.
`ufm_source` controls the policy for UFM credentials, and
`bmc_site_wide_root_source` controls version 0 of the site-wide BMC root.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `ufm_source` | `UfmCredentialSource` | `local_first` | UFM credential policy. `local_first` reads environment/file entries before falling back to the persistent backend and writes to the backend. `backend` ignores local UFM entries. `local` makes environment/file entries authoritative and rejects persistent-backend UFM mutations. |
| `bmc_site_wide_root_source` | `BmcSiteWideRootSource` | `local_first` | Version 0 site-wide BMC root policy. `local_first` reads environment, then file, before falling back to the persistent backend and writes to the backend. `backend` ignores the local v0 entry. `local` reads environment, then file, with no backend fallback and rejects backend v0 mutations. Versioned roots always use persistent backends. |
| `file` | `Option<CredentialFileSourceConfig>` | — | Watched JSON or YAML static-credential file (see [CredentialFileSourceConfig](#credentialfilesourceconfig)). When present, it replaces the legacy file source selected by `CARBIDE_CREDENTIALS_FILE_*`; the environment source remains first when enabled. |

When `ufm_source = "local"` and InfiniBand management is enabled, startup
requires a local `ufm_auth_by_fabric` entry for every configured fabric. The
mode is all-or-nothing: NICo does not fall back to Vault or Postgres for a
missing fabric. When `ufm_source` is omitted, `local_first` preserves the
pre-existing local-override behavior.

When `bmc_site_wide_root_source = "local"`, readers report a missing local
version 0 as unavailable without falling back to a persistent backend. With
DPF enabled, Core requires local v0 before startup on both fresh and existing
sites whenever v0 is current or the current target cannot be resolved. This
prevents a rolling update from activating local ownership while an older
replica can still register a DPU that uses the shared credential. On a transient
rotation-target read failure, a present local v0 permits startup and retry. After
accepting local v0, NICo retains that last shared value and logs an error if the
entry disappears. To recover, restore the local value unchanged. The default pinned DPF
v26.4.0 does not support BMC credential rotation, so NICo retains the shared
Secret. Adopting and validating supporting DPF behavior is tracked by
[#6147](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/issues/6147). Other current
BMC rotation targets follow the same retention rule when absent from their
authoritative source. During background refresh, a transient source-read
failure retains the last published Secret and is retried.
The setting does not affect versioned site-wide BMC roots,
per-device BMC credentials, or BMC rotation.

Treat a local version 0 value as bootstrap and ingestion input. Watched reload
may add or correct it before any managed device begins using version 0. After
ingestion starts, keep it unchanged: changing only the read source does not
update BMC hardware or credential-convergence records. Use coordinated BMC
credential rotation to advance to a backend-managed version instead. On DPF
sites, do not rotate while DPF manages any DPU: the shared BMC Secret cannot
authenticate a fleet split between old and new passwords; see
[#6147](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/issues/6147).

#### Environment credential source

The environment source is disabled by default. Set
`CARBIDE_CREDENTIALS_ENV_ENABLED=true` on the `nico-api` process to enable it;
the only accepted boolean values are `true` and `false`. The optional
`CARBIDE_CREDENTIALS_ENV_PREFIX` overrides the default
`CARBIDE_STATIC_CREDENTIAL_` prefix. Trailing underscores are removed from the
configured prefix, then `__` separates each nested field.

For example, these variables provide both fields required for the `default`
UFM fabric using the default prefix:

```bash
export CARBIDE_CREDENTIALS_ENV_ENABLED=true
export CARBIDE_STATIC_CREDENTIAL__UFM_AUTH_BY_FABRIC__DEFAULT__USERNAME=ignored-for-token-or-certificate-auth
export CARBIDE_STATIC_CREDENTIAL__UFM_AUTH_BY_FABRIC__DEFAULT__PASSWORD=bearer-token-or-empty
```

Environment credentials are snapshotted at process startup. Changing them
requires restarting `nico-api`; use the watched file source for supported
live-reload workflows. The site-wide BMC root version 0 has the bootstrap-only
boundary described above. With `ufm_source = "local_first"`, an environment entry
overrides the corresponding file and persistent-backend entries. With
`ufm_source = "local"`, every configured fabric must be present in the enabled
environment/file sources.

For version 0 of the site-wide BMC root, the environment entry likewise
precedes the file entry in `local_first` and `local` modes. Versioned roots do
not use either local source.

### `CredentialFileSourceConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `path` | `PathBuf` | **required** | Absolute or working-directory-relative path to a JSON or YAML credential file. The file must exist and parse at startup. |
| `poll_interval` | `Duration` | `60s` | Nonzero interval used in addition to filesystem events to detect projected-Secret replacements. Startup rejects zero. |

The watcher keeps the last valid snapshot when a reload fails. A UFM-only YAML
file has the following shape; both `username` and `password` are required. The
password is the bearer token, while an empty password selects the default
SPIFFE client certificate:

```yaml
ufm_auth_by_fabric:
  default:
    username: ignored-for-token-or-certificate-auth
    password: bearer-token-or-empty
```

A sparse file may instead contain only version 0 of the site-wide BMC root:

```yaml
bmc_site_wide_root:
  username: root
  password: example
```

With `bmc_site_wide_root_source = "local"`, the watched Kubernetes Secret may
supply or correct this value before ingestion without restarting NICo. Do not
change it after a managed device begins using version 0; use coordinated BMC
rotation to advance to a backend-managed version instead. DPF sites must not
rotate while DPUs rely on the shared BMC Secret; see
[#6147](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/issues/6147). Use a Secret
rather than a ConfigMap for credential data.

### `SecretsConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `kms` | `KmsConfig` | **required** | KMS backend configuration (see [KmsConfig](#kmsconfig)). |
| `routing` | `HashMap<String, String>` | **required** | Maps path prefixes to the `kek_id` that encrypts new writes under them, longest prefix winning. A `/` catch-all entry is required. Reads never consult routing — every stored row records the KEK that wrote it. |
| `backends` | `Vec<CredentialBackend>` | `[vault]` | The persistent-backend read order, highest priority first (first match wins). Enabled local overrides are normally tried first. Source policies may make selected local entries authoritative or suppress them. |
| `writer` | `CredentialBackend` | `vault` | Where new credential writes go. Set to `postgres` to send new writes to the journal; independent of `backends`. Mutations are rejected for credentials whose source policy is `local`. |
| `import_from` | `Option<ImportSource>` | — | A source backend to import secrets from at startup. Only `vault` is supported. The import excludes the `ufm/` subtree when `credentials.ufm_source = "local"`, and only the unversioned site-wide BMC root when `credentials.bmc_site_wide_root_source = "local"`. An excluded-only import still records completion. Unset means a fresh site with nothing to import. |
| `import_approach` | `ImportApproach` | `missing_only` | How to treat secrets that already exist in Postgres during import. |

### `KmsConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `active` | `String` | **required** | The provider that wraps DEKs for new writes. |
| `providers` | `HashMap<String, ProviderConfig>` | **required** | Named provider configurations (see [ProviderConfig](#providerconfig)). |

### `ProviderConfig`

Each entry in `providers` is tagged by `type`. Unknown fields are rejected.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `type` | `"integrated"` or `"transit"` | **required** | `integrated` holds key material in the NICo process; `transit` wraps and unwraps DEKs in Vault/OpenBao Transit so KEK material never leaves the KMS. |
| `keys` (`integrated`) | `HashMap<String, KeySource>` | **required, non-empty** | Maps each `kek_id` to where its base64-encoded 256-bit key loads from: `{ env = "NAME" }`, `{ file = "/path" }`, or `{ value = "<base64>" }`. Each key must decode to exactly 32 bytes; a missing variable or unreadable file fails the boot, and a key file readable by group or others logs a warning. Inline `value` is development/test-only because the config is logged at startup and shown on the admin web page. |
| `keys` (`transit`) | `Vec<String>` | **required** | Transit key names this provider answers for. |
| `transit_mount` (`transit`) | `Option<String>` | `"transit"` | Secrets-engine mount path. Transit requires a static token in `VAULT_TOKEN`; the Kubernetes service-account login flow is not supported for Transit. |

### `CertificatesConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `backend` | `CertBackendKind` | `shared_vault` | Which backend issues certificates: `shared_vault` reuses the credential store's Vault client (one client, one token lease), `dedicated_vault` uses a separately-configured Vault. |
| `dedicated_vault` | `Option<DedicatedVaultSettings>` | — | Connection settings for a dedicated certificate Vault (see [DedicatedVaultSettings](#dedicatedvaultsettings)). Required when `backend = "dedicated_vault"`, ignored otherwise. |

### `DedicatedVaultSettings`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `address` | `String` | **required, non-empty** | Vault address, e.g. `https://vault-certs.example:8200`. |
| `pki_mount_location` | `String` | **required, non-empty** | PKI secrets-engine mount path on the target Vault. |
| `pki_role_name` | `String` | **required, non-empty** | PKI role used to sign leaf certificates. |
| `token` | `Option<String>` | — | Token for root-token auth; required only when the pod has no Kubernetes service-account token. |
| `vault_cacert` | `Option<String>` | — | CA bundle that signs the target Vault's TLS cert. Defaults to the site root / `VAULT_CACERT`. |

### `RackValidationConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enables rack validation testing. |
| `run_interval` | `Duration` | `60s` | Interval between rack validation controller runs. |
